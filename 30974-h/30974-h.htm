<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="chapsub">"RABBITS"</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimbo's</span> governess ought to have known
better&mdash;but she didn't. If she had, Jimbo
would never have met with the adventures
that subsequently came to him. Thus, in a
roundabout sort of way, the child ought to
have been thankful to the governess; and
perhaps, in a roundabout sort of way, he was.
But that comes at the far end of the story,
and is doubtful at best; and in the meanwhile
the child had gone through his suffering, and
the governess had in some measure expiated
her fault; so that at this stage it is only
necessary to note that the whole business
began because the Empty House happened to
be really an Empty House&mdash;not the one
Jimbo's family lived in, but another of which
more will be known in due course.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>Jimbo's father was a retired Colonel, who
had married late in life, and now lived all the
year round in the country; and Jimbo was
the youngest child but one. The Colonel, lean
in body as he was sincere in mind, an excellent
soldier but a poor diplomatist, loved dogs,
horses, guns and riding-whips. He also really
understood them. His neighbours, had they
been asked, would have called him hard-headed,
and so far as a soft-hearted man
may deserve the title, he probably was. He
rode two horses a day to hounds with the
best of them, and the stiffer the country the
better he liked it. Besides his guns, dogs
and horses, he was also very fond of his
children. It was his hobby that he understood
them far better than his wife did, or
than any one else did, for that matter. The
proper evolution of their differing temperaments
had no difficulties for him. The delicate
problems of child-nature, which defy solution
by nine parents out of ten, ceased to exist the
moment he spread out his muscular hand in
a favourite omnipotent gesture and uttered
some extraordinarily foolish generality in that
thunderous, good-natured voice of his. The
difficulty for himself vanished when he ended
up with the words, "Leave that to me, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
dear; believe me, I know best!" But for
all else concerned, and especially for the child
under discussion, this was when the difficulty
really began.</p>

<p>Since, however, the Colonel, after this
chapter, mounts his best hunter and disappears
over a high hedge into space so far
as our story is concerned, any further delineation
of his wholesome but very ordinary type
is unnecessary.</p>

<p>One winter's evening, not very long after
Christmas, the Colonel made a discovery. It
alarmed him a little; for it suggested to his
cocksure mind that he did not understand
<em>all</em> his children as comprehensively as he
imagined.</p>

<p>Between five o'clock tea and dinner&mdash;that
magic hour when lessons were over and the
big house was full of shadows and mystery&mdash;there
came a timid knock at the study door.</p>

<p>"Come in," growled the soldier in his
deepest voice, and a little girl's face, wreathed
in tumbling brown hair, poked itself hesitatingly
through the opening.</p>

<p>The Colonel did not like being disturbed at
this hour, and everybody in the house knew
it; but the spell of Christmas holidays was
still somehow in the air, and the customary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
order was not yet fully re-established. Moreover,
when he saw who the intruder was, his
growl modified itself into a sort of common
sternness that yet was not cleverly enough
simulated to deceive the really intuitive little
person who now stood inside the room.</p>

<p>"Well, Nixie, child, what do you want
now?"</p>

<p>"Please, father, will you&mdash;we wondered
if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A chorus of whispers issued from the other
side of the door:</p>

<p>"Go on, silly!"</p>

<p>"Out with it!"</p>

<p>"You promised you would, Nixie."</p>

<p>"... if you would come and play Rabbits
with us?" came the words in a desperate
rush, with laughter not far behind.</p>

<p>The big man with the fierce white moustaches
glared over the top of his glasses at
the intruders as if amazed beyond belief at
the audacity of the request.</p>

<p>"Rabbits!" he exclaimed, as though the
mere word ought to have caused an instant
explosion. "Rabbits!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>please</em> do."</p>

<p>"Rabbits at this time of night!" he
repeated. "I never heard of such a thing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Why, all good rabbits are asleep in their
holes by now. And you ought to be in yours
too by rights, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"We don't sleep in holes, father," said the
owner of the brown hair, who was acting as
leader.</p>

<p>"And there's still a nour before bedtime,
<em>really</em>," added a voice in the rear.</p>

<p>The big man slowly put his glasses down and
looked at his watch. He looked very savage,
but of course it was all pretence, and the
children knew it. "If he was <em>really</em> cross he'd
pretend to be nice," they whispered to each
other, with merciless perception.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" he began. But he who hesitates,
with children, is lost. The door flung
open wide, and the troop poured into the
room in a medley of long black legs, flying
hair and outstretched hands. They surrounded
the table, swarmed upon his big
knees, shut his stupid old book, tried on his
glasses, kissed him, and fell to discussing the
game breathlessly all at once, as though it
had already begun.</p>

<p>This, of course, ended the battle, and the
big man had to play the part of the Monster
Rabbit in a wonderful game of his own invention.
But when, at length, it was all over,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and they were gathered panting round the fire
of blazing logs in the hall, the Monster Rabbit&mdash;the
only one with any breath at his command&mdash;looked
up and spoke.</p>

<p>"Where's Jimbo?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Upstairs."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he come and play too?"</p>

<p>"He didn't want to."</p>

<p>"Why? What's he doing?"</p>

<p>Several answers were forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Nothing in p'tickler."</p>

<p>"Talking to the furniture when I last saw
him."</p>

<p>"Just thinking, as usual, or staring in the
fire."</p>

<p>None of the answers seemed to satisfy the
Monster Rabbit, for when he kissed them a
little later and said good-night, he gave orders,
with a graver face, for Jimbo to be sent down
to the study before he went to bed. Moreover,
he called him "James," which was a
sure sign of parental displeasure.</p>

<p>"James, why didn't you come and play
with your brothers and sisters just now?"
asked the Colonel, as a dreamy-eyed boy of
about eight, with a mop of dark hair and a
wistful expression, came slowly forward into
the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p><p>"I was in the middle of making pictures."</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;what&mdash;making pictures?"</p>

<p>"In the fire."</p>

<p>"James," said the Colonel in a serious
tone, "don't you know that you are getting
too old now for that sort of thing? If you
dream so much, you'll fall asleep altogether
some fine day, and never wake up again.
Just think what that means!"</p>

<p>The child smiled faintly and moved up confidingly
between his father's knees, staring
into his eyes without the least sign of fear.
But he said nothing in reply. His thoughts
were far away, and it seemed as if the effort
to bring them back into the study and to a
consideration of his father's words was almost
beyond his power.</p>

<p>"You must run about more," pursued the
soldier, rubbing his big hands together briskly,
"and join your brothers and sisters in their
games. Lie about in the summer and dream
a bit if you like, but now it's winter, you must
be more active, and make your blood circulate
healthily,&mdash;er&mdash;and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>The words were kindly spoken, but the
voice and manner rather deliberate. Jimbo
began to look a little troubled, as his father
watched him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p><p>"Come now, little man," he said more
gently, "what's the matter, eh?" He
drew the boy close to him. "Tell me all
about it, and what it is you're always thinking
about so much."</p>

<p>Jimbo brought back his mind with a tremendous
effort, and said, "I don't like the
winter. It's so dark and full of horrid things.
It's all ice and shadows, so&mdash;so I go away and
think of what I like, and other places&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" interrupted his father briskly;
"winter's a capital time for boys. What in
the world d'ye mean, I wonder?"</p>

<p>He lifted the child on to his knee and
stroked his hair, as though he were patting
the flank of a horse. Jimbo took no notice of
the interruption or of the caress, but went on
saying what he had to say, though with eyes
a little more clouded.</p>

<p>"Winter's like going into a long black
tunnel, you see. It's downhill to Christmas,
of course, and then uphill all the way to the
summer holidays. But the uphill part's so
slow that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" laughed the Colonel in spite
of himself; "you mustn't have such thoughts.
Those are a baby's notions. They're silly,
silly, silly."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>"Do you <em>really</em> think so, father?" continued
the boy, as if politeness demanded
some recognition of his father's remarks, but
otherwise anxious only to say what was in
his mind. "You wouldn't think them silly
if you really knew. But, of course, there's
no one to tell you in the stable, so you <em>can't</em>
know. You've never seen the funny big
people rushing past you and laughing through
their long hair when the wind blows so loud.
<em>I</em> know several of them almost to speak to,
but you hear only wind. And the other
things with tiny legs that skate up and down
the slippery moonbeams, without ever tumbling
off&mdash;they aren't silly a bit, only they
don't like dogs and noise. And I've seen the
furniture"&mdash;he pronounced it furchinur&mdash;"dancing
about in the day-nursery when it
thought it was alone, and I've heard it talking
at night. I know the big cupboard's voice
quite well. It's just like a drum, only
rougher...."</p>

<p>The Colonel shook his head and frowned
severely, staring hard at his son. But though
their eyes met, the boy hardly saw him. Far
away at the other end of the dark Tunnel of
the Months he saw the white summer sunshine
lying over gardens full of nodding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
flowers. Butterflies were flitting across
meadows yellow with buttercups, and he saw
the fascinating rings upon the lawn where the
Fairy People held their dances in the moonlight;
he heard the wind call to him as it
ran on along by the hedgerows, and saw the
gentle pressure of its swift feet upon the
standing hay; streams were murmuring under
shady trees; birds were singing; and there
were echoes of sweeter music still that he
could not understand, but loved all the more
perhaps on that account....</p>

<p>"Yes," announced the Colonel later that
evening to his wife, spreading his hands out
as he spoke. "Yes, my dear, I <em>have</em> made a
discovery, and an alarming one. You know,
I'm rarely at fault where the children are
concerned&mdash;and I've noted all the symptoms
with unusual care. James, my dear, is an
imaginative boy."</p>

<p>He paused to note the effect of his words,
but seeing none, continued:</p>

<p>"I regret to be obliged to say it, but it's
a fact beyond dispute. His head is simply
full of things, and he talked to me this evening
about tunnels and slippery moonlight till I
very nearly lost my temper altogether. Now,
the boy will never make a man unless we take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
him in hand properly at once. We must get
him a governess, or something, without delay.
Just fancy, if he grew up into a poet or one
of these&mdash;these&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In his distress the soldier could only think
of horse-terms, which did not seem quite the
right language. He stuck altogether, and
kept repeating the favourite gesture with his
open hand, staring at his wife over his glasses
as he did so.</p>

<p>But the mother never argued.</p>

<p>"He's very young still," she observed
quietly, "and, as you have always said, he's
not a bit like other boys, remember."</p>

<p>"Exactly what I say. Now that your eyes
are opened to the actual state of affairs, I'm
satisfied."</p>

<p>"We'll get a sensible nursery-governess at
once," added the mother.</p>

<p>"A practical one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Hard-headed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And well educated?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;er&mdash;firm with children. She'll do
for the lot, then."</p>

<p>"If possible."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p><p>"And a young woman who doesn't go in
for poetry, and dreaming, and all that kind
of flummery."</p>

<p>"Of course, dear."</p>

<p>"Capital. I felt sure you would agree
with me," he went on. "It'd be no end of a
pity if Jimbo grew up an ass. At present he
hardly knows the difference between a roadster
and a racer. He's going into the army, too,"
he added by way of climax, "and you know,
my dear, the army would never stand <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>"Never," said the mother quietly, and the
conversation came to an end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the subject of these remarks
was lying wide awake upstairs in the bed
with the yellow iron railing round it. His
elder brother was asleep in the opposite corner
of the room, snoring peacefully. He could
just see the brass knobs of the bedstead as
the dying firelight quivered and shone on them.
The walls and ceiling were draped in shadows
that altered their shapes from time to time as
the coals dropped softly into the grate. Gradually
the fire sank, and the room darkened.
A feeling of delight and awe stole into his
heart.</p>

<p>Jimbo loved these early hours of the night
before sleep came. He felt no fear of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
dark; its mystery thrilled his soul; but he
liked the summer dark, with its soft, warm
silences better than the chill winter shadows.
Presently the firelight sprang up into a brief
flame and then died away altogether with an
odd little gulp. He knew the sound well;
he often watched the fire out, and now, as he
lay in bed waiting for he knew not what, the
moonlight filtered in through the baize curtains
and gradually gave to the room a wholly new
character.</p>

<p>Jimbo sat up in bed and listened. The
house was very still. He slipped into his red
dressing-gown and crept noiselessly over to
the window. For a moment he paused by
his brother's bed to make sure that he really
was asleep; then, evidently satisfied, he
drew aside a corner of the curtain and peered
out.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said, drawing in his breath with
delight, and again "oh!"</p>

<p>It was difficult to understand why the sea
of white moonlight that covered the lawn
should fill him with such joy, and at the same
time bring a lump into his throat. It made
him feel as if he were swelling out into something
very much greater than the actual
limits of his little person. And the sensation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was one of mingled pain and delight, too
intense for him to feel for very long. The unhappiness
passed gradually away, he always
noticed, and the happiness merged after a
while into a sort of dreamy ecstasy in which
he neither thought nor wished much, but was
conscious only of one single unmanageable
yearning.</p>

<p>The huge cedars on the lawn reared themselves
up like giants in silver cloaks, and the
horse-chestnut&mdash;the Umbrella Tree, as the
children called it&mdash;loomed with motionless
branches that were frosted and shining.
Beyond it, in a blue mist of moonlight and
distance, lay the kitchen-garden; he could
just make out the line of the high wall where
the fruit-trees grew. Immediately below him
the gravel of the carriage drive sparkled with
frost.</p>

<p>The bars of the windows were cold to his
hands, yet he stood there for a long time with
his nose flattened against the pane and his
bare feet on the cane chair. He felt both
happy and sad; his heart longed dreadfully
for something he had not got, something that
seemed out of his reach because he could not
name it. No one seemed to believe all the
things he <em>knew</em> in quite the same way as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
did. His brothers and sisters played up to a
certain point, and then put the things aside
as if they had only been assumed for the time
and were not real. To him they were always
real. His father's words, too, that evening
had sorely puzzled him when he came to
think over them afterwards: "They're a
baby's notions.... They're silly, silly, silly."
Were these things real or were they not?
And, as he pondered, yearning dumbly, as only
these little souls can yearn, the wistfulness in
his heart went out to meet the moonlight in
the air. Together they wove a spell that
seemed to summon before him a fairy of the
night, who whispered an answer into his
heart: "We are real so long as you believe
in us. It is your imagination that makes us
real and gives us life. Please, never, never
stop believing."</p>

<p>Jimbo was not quite sure that he understood
the message, but he liked it all the same,
and felt comforted. So long as they believed
in one another, the rest did not matter very
much after all. And when at last, shivering
with cold, he crept back to bed, it was only
to find through the Gates of Sleep a more
direct way to the things he had been thinking
about, and to wander for the rest of the night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
unwatched and free, through the wonders of
an Enchanted Land.</p>

<p>Jimbo, as his father had said, was an
imaginative child. Most children are&mdash;more
or less; and he was "more," at least, "more"
than his brothers and sisters. The Colonel
thought he had made a penetrating discovery,
but his wife had known it always. His head,
indeed, was "full of things,"&mdash;things that,
unless trained into a channel where they
could be controlled and properly schooled,
would certainly interfere with his success in
a practical world, and be a source of mingled
pain and joy to him all through life. To have
trained these forces, ever bursting out towards
creation, in his little soul,&mdash;to have explained,
interpreted, and dealt fairly by them, would
perhaps have been the best and wisest way;
to have suppressed them altogether, cleaned
them out by the process of substitution, this
might have succeeded too in less measure; but
to turn them into a veritable rout of horror by
the common method of "frightening the nonsense
out of the boy," this was surely the very
worst way of dealing with such a case, and the
most cruel. Yet, this was the method adopted
by the Colonel in the robust good-nature of
his heart, and the utter ignorance of his soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
So it came about that three months later,
when May was melting into June, Miss Ethel
Lake arrived upon the scene as a result of
the Colonel's blundering good intentions. She
brought with her a kind disposition, a supreme
ignorance of unordinary children, a large store
of self-confidence&mdash;and a corded yellow tin
box.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="chapsub">MISS LAKE COMES&mdash;AND GOES</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conversation took place suddenly one
afternoon, and no one knew anything about
it except the two who took part in it: the
Colonel asked the governess to try and knock
the nonsense out of Jimbo's head, and the
governess promised eagerly to do her very
best. It was her first "place"; and by
"nonsense" they both understood imagination.
True enough, Jimbo's mother had
given her rather different instructions as to
the treatment of the boy, but she mistook
the soldier's bluster for authority, and deemed
it best to obey him. This was her first
mistake.</p>

<p>In reality she was not devoid of imaginative
insight; it was simply that her anxiety
to prove a success permitted her better
judgment to be overborne by the Colonel's
boisterous manner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p><p>The wisdom of the mother was greater than
that of her husband. For the safe development
of that tender and imaginative little boy
of hers, she had been at great pains to engage
a girl&mdash;a clergyman's daughter&mdash;who possessed
sufficient sympathy with the poetic
and dreamy nature to be of real help to him;
for true help, she knew, can only come from
true understanding. And Miss Lake was a
good girl. She was entirely well-meaning&mdash;which
is the beginning of well-doing, and her
principal weakness lay in her judgment, which
led her to obey the Colonel too literally.</p>

<p>"She seems most sensible," he declared to
his wife.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"And practical."</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"And firm and&mdash;er&mdash;wise with children."</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Just the sort for young Jimbo," added
the Colonel with decision.</p>

<p>"I trust so; she's a little young, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Possibly, but one can't get everything,"
said her husband, in his horse-and-dog voice.
"A year with her should clean out that fanciful
brain of his, and prepare him for school
with other boys. He'll be all right once he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
gets to school. My dear," he added, spreading
out his right hand, fingers extended, "you've
made a most wise selection. I congratulate
you. I'm delighted."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad."</p>

<p>"Capital, I repeat, capital. You're a clever
little woman. I knew you'd find the right
party, once I showed you how the land lay."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Empty House, that stood in its neglected
garden not far from the Park gates,
was built on a point of land that entered
wedgewise into the Colonel's estate. Though
something of an eyesore, therefore, he could
do nothing with it.</p>

<p>To the children it had always been an
object of peculiar, though not unwholesome,
mystery. None of them cared to pass it on
a stormy day&mdash;the wind made such odd noises
in its empty corridors and rooms&mdash;and they
refused point-blank to go within hailing distance
of it after dark. But in Jimbo's imagination
it was especially haunted, and if he
had ceased to reveal to the others what he
<em>knew</em> went on under its roof, it was only because
they were unable to follow him, and were
inclined to greet his extravagant recitals with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
"Now, Jimbo, you know <em>perfectly</em> well you're
only making up."</p>

<p>The House had been empty for many years;
but, to the children, it had been empty since
the beginning of the world, since what they
called the "<em>very</em> beginning." They believed&mdash;well,
each child believed according to his
own mind and powers, but there was at least
one belief they all held in common: for it
was generally accepted as an article of faith
that the Indians, encamped among the
shrubberies on the back lawn, secretly buried
their dead behind the crumbling walls of its
weedy garden&mdash;the "dead" provided by the
children's battles, be it understood. Wakeful
ears in the night-nursery had heard strange
sounds coming from that direction when the
windows were open on hot summer nights;
and the gardener, supreme authority on all
that happened in the night (since they believed
that he sat up to watch the vegetables and
fruit-trees ripen, and never went to bed at
all), was evidently of the same persuasion.</p>

<p>When appealed to for an explanation of the
mournful wind-voices, he knew what was
expected of him, and rose manfully to the
occasion.</p>

<p>"It's either them Redskins aburyin' wot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
you killed of 'em yesterday," he declared,
pointing towards the Empty House with a
bit of broken flower-pot, "or else it's the
ones you killed last week, and who was always
astealin' of my strorbriz." He looked very
wise as he said this, and his wand of office&mdash;a
dirty trowel&mdash;which he held in his hand,
gave him tremendous dignity.</p>

<p>"That's just what <em>we</em> thought, and of course
if you say so too, that settles it," said
Nixie.</p>

<p>"It's more'n likely, missie, leastways from
wot you describes, which it is a hempty house
all the same, though I can't say as I've heard
no sounds, not very distinct that is, myself."</p>

<p>The gardener may have been anxious to
hedge a bit, for fear of a scolding from headquarters,
but his cryptic remarks pleased the
children greatly, because it showed, they
thought, that they knew more than the
gardener did.</p>

<p>Thus the Empty House remained an object
of somewhat dreadful delight, lending a touch
of wonderland to that part of the lane where
it stood, and forming the background for
many an enchanting story over the nursery
fire in winter-time. It appealed vividly to
their imaginations, especially to Jimbo's. Its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
dark windows, without blinds, were sometimes
full of faces that retreated the moment
they were looked at. That tangled ivy did
not grow over the roof so thickly for nothing;
and those high elms on the western side had
not been planted years ago in a semicircle
without a reason. Thus, at least, the children
argued, not knowing exactly what they meant,
nor caring much, so long as they proved to
their own satisfaction that the place was
properly haunted, and therefore worthy of
their attention.</p>

<p>It was natural they should lead Miss Lake
in that direction on one of their first walks
together, and it was natural, too, that she
should at once discover from their manner
that the place was of some importance to
them.</p>

<p>"What a queer-looking old house," she
remarked, when they turned the corner of
the lane and it came into view. "Almost a
ruin, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The children exchanged glances. A "ruin"
did not seem the right sort of word at all;
and, besides, was a little disrespectful. Also,
they were not sure whether the new governess
ought to be told everything so soon. She
had not really won their confidence yet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
After a slight pause&mdash;and a children's pause
is the most eloquent imaginable&mdash;Nixie, being
the eldest, said in a stiff little voice: "It's
the Empty House, Miss Lake. <em>We</em> know it
very well indeed."</p>

<p>"It looks empty," observed Miss Lake
briskly.</p>

<p>"But it's not a ruin, of course," added the
child, with the cold dignity of chosen spokesman.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the governess, quite missing
the point. She was talking lightly on the
surface of things, wholly ignorant of the depths
beneath her feet, intuition with her having
always been sternly repressed.</p>

<p>"It's a gamekeeper's cottage, or something
like that, I suppose," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; it isn't a bit."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it belong to your father, then?"</p>

<p>"No. It's somebody else's, you see."</p>

<p>"Then you can't have it pulled down?"</p>

<p>"Rather not! Of course not!" exclaimed
several indignant voices at once.</p>

<p>Miss Lake perceived for the first time that
it held more than ordinary importance in their
mind.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," she said. "What is
its history, and who used to live in it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p><p>There came another pause. The children
looked into each others' faces. They gazed
at the blue sky overhead; then they stared
at the dusty road at their feet. But no one
volunteered an answer. Miss Lake, they felt,
was approaching the subject in an offensive
manner.</p>

<p>"Why are you all so mysterious about it?"
she went on. "It's only a tumble-down old
place, and must be very draughty to live in,
even for a gamekeeper."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Come, children, don't you hear me? I'm
asking you a question."</p>

<p>A couple of startled birds flew out of the
ivy with a great whirring of wings. This was
followed by a faint sound of rumbling, that
seemed to come from the interior of the house.
Outside all was still, and the hot sunshine lay
over everything. The sound was repeated.
The children looked at each other with large,
expectant eyes. Something in the house was
moving&mdash;was coming nearer.</p>

<p>"Have you <em>all</em> lost your tongues?" asked
the governess impatiently.</p>

<p>"But you see," Nixie said at length,
"somebody <em>does</em> live in it now."</p>

<p>"And who is he?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>"I didn't say it was a <em>man</em>."</p>

<p>"Whoever it is&mdash;tell me about the person,"
persisted Miss Lake.</p>

<p>"There's really nothing to tell," replied
the child, without looking up.</p>

<p>"Oh, but there must be something,"
declared the logical young governess, "or you
wouldn't object so much to its being pulled
down."</p>

<p>Nixie looked puzzled, but Jimbo came to
the rescue at once.</p>

<p>"But <em>you</em> wouldn't understand if we did
tell you," he said, in a slow, respectful voice.
His tone held a touch of that indescribable
scorn heard sometimes in a child's tone&mdash;the
utter contempt for the stupid grown-up
creature. Miss Lake noticed, and felt annoyed.
She recognised that she was not getting on
well with the children, and it piqued her.
She remembered the Colonel's words about
"knocking the nonsense out" of James' head,
and she saw that her first opportunity, in fact
her first real test, was at hand.</p>

<p>"And why, pray, should I not understand?"
she asked, with some sharpness. "Is the
mystery so <em>very</em> great?"</p>

<p>For some reason the duty of spokesman now
devolved unmistakably upon Jimbo; and very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
seriously too, he accepted the task, standing
with his feet firmly planted in the road and
his hands in his trousers' pockets.</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Lake," he began gravely,
"we know such a lot of Things in there, that
they might not like us to tell you about them.
They don't know you yet. If they did it
might be different. But&mdash;but&mdash;you see, it
isn't."</p>

<p>This was rather crushing to the aspiring
educator, and the Colonel's instructions gained
additional point in the light of the boy's
explanation.</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks!" she laughed, "there's probably
nothing at all in there, except rats and
cobwebs. 'Things,' indeed!"</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't understand," said
Jimbo coolly, with no sign of being offended.
"How could you?" He glanced at his
sisters, gaining so much support from their
enigmatical faces that he added, for their
especial benefit, "How could she?"</p>

<p>"The gard'ner said so too," chimed in a
younger sister, with a vague notion that their
precious Empty House was being robbed of
its glory.</p>

<p>"Yes; but, James, dear, I do understand
perfectly," continued Miss Lake more gently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and wisely ignoring the reference to the
authority of the kitchen-garden. "Only, you
see, I cannot really encourage you in such
nonsense&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't nonsense," interrupted Jimbo,
with heat.</p>

<p>"But, believe me, children, it <em>is</em> nonsense.
How do you know that there's anything
inside? You've never been there!"</p>

<p>"You can know perfectly well what's inside
a thing without having gone there," replied
Jimbo with scorn. "At least, <em>we</em> can."</p>

<p>Miss Lake changed her tack a little&mdash;fatally,
as it appeared afterwards.</p>

<p>"I know at any rate," she said with
decision, "that there's nothing good in there.
Whatever there may be is bad, thoroughly
bad, and not fit for you to play with."</p>

<p>The other children moved away, but Jimbo
stood his ground. They were all angry, disappointed,
sore hurt and offended. But
Jimbo suddenly began to feel something else
besides anger and vexation. It was a new
point of view to him that the Empty House
might contain bad things as well as good, or
perhaps, only bad things. His imagination
seized upon the point at once and set to work
vigorously to develop it. This was his way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with all such things, and he could not prevent
it.</p>

<p>"Bad Things?" he repeated, looking up
at the governess. "You mean Things that
could hurt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she said, noting the effect
of her words and thinking how pleased the
Colonel would be later, when he heard it.
"Things that might run out and catch you
some day when you're passing here alone,
and take you back a prisoner. Then you'd
be a prisoner in the Empty House all your
life. Think of that!"</p>

<p>Miss Lake mistook the boy's silence as proof
that she was taking the right line. She
enlarged upon this view of the matter, now
she was so successfully launched, and described
the <em>Inmate of the House</em> with such wealth of
detail that she felt sure her listener would
never have anything to do with the place
again, and that she had "knocked out" this
particular bit of "nonsense" for ever and
a day.</p>

<p>But to Jimbo it was a new and horrible idea
that the Empty House, haunted hitherto only
by rather jolly and wonderful Red Indians,
contained a Monster who might take him
prisoner, and the thought made him feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
afraid. The mischief had, of course, been
done, and the terror in his eyes was unmistakable,
when the foolish governess saw her
mistake. Retreat was impossible: the boy
was shaking with fear; and not all Miss
Lake's genuine sympathy, or Nixie's explanations
and soothings, were able to relieve his
mind of its new burden.</p>

<p>Hitherto Jimbo's imagination had loved to
dwell upon the pleasant side of things invisible;
but now he had been severely frightened, and
his imagination took a new turn. Not only
the Empty House, but all his inner world, to
which it was in some sense the key, underwent
a distressing change. His sense of horror had
been vividly aroused.</p>

<p>The governess would willingly have corrected
her mistake, but was, of course, powerless
to do so. Bitterly she regretted her
tactlessness and folly. But she could do
nothing, and to add to her distress, she saw
that Jimbo shrank from her in a way that
could not long escape the watchful eye of the
mother. But, if the boy shed tears of fear
that night in his bed, it must in justice be told
that she, for her part, cried bitterly in her
own room, not that she had endangered her
"place," but that she had done a cruel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
injury to a child, and that she was helpless
to undo it. For she loved children, though
she was quite unsuited to take care of them.
Her just reward, however, came swiftly upon
her.</p>

<p>A few nights later, when Jimbo and Nixie
were allowed to come down to dessert, the
wind was heard to make a queer moaning
sound in the ivy branches that hung over the
dining-room windows. Jimbo heard it too.
He held his breath for a minute; then he
looked round the table in a frightened way,
and the next minute gave a scream and burst
into tears. He ran round and buried his face
in his father's arms.</p>

<p>After the tears came the truth. It was a
bad thing for Miss Ethel Lake, this little
sighing of the wind and the ivy leaves, for
the Djin of terror she had thoughtlessly
evoked swept into the room and introduced
himself to the parents without her leave.</p>

<p>"What new nonsense is this now?" growled
the soldier, leaving his walnuts and lifting the
boy on to his knee. "He shouldn't come
down till he's a little older, and knows how to
behave."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, darling child?" asked
the mother, drying his eyes tenderly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p><p>"I heard the bad Things crying in the
Empty House."</p>

<p>"The Empty House is a mile away from
here!" snorted the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Then it's come nearer," declared the
frightened boy.</p>

<p>"Who told you there were bad things in
the Empty House?" asked the mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, who told you, indeed, I should like
to know!" demanded the Colonel.</p>

<p>And then it all came out. The Colonel's
wife was very quiet, but very determined.
Miss Lake went back to the clerical family
whence she had come, and the children knew
her no more.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," said Nixie, expressing the
verdict of the nursery. "I thought she was
awfully stupid."</p>

<p>"She wasn't a real lake at all," declared
another, "she was only a sort of puddle."</p>

<p>Jimbo, however, said little, and the Colonel
likewise held his peace.</p>

<p>But the governess, whether she was a lake
or only a puddle, left her mark behind her.
The Empty House was no longer harmless.
It had a new lease of life. It was tenanted
by some one who could never have friendly
relations with children. The weeds in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
old garden took on fantastic shapes; figures
hid behind the doors and crept about the
passages; the rooks in the high elms became
birds of ill-omen; the ivy bristled upon the
walls, and the trivial explanations of the
gardener were no longer satisfactory.</p>

<p>Even in bright sunshine a Shadow lay
crouching upon the broken roof. At any
moment it might leap into life, and with
immense striding legs chase the children down
to the very Park gates.</p>

<p>There was no need to enforce the decree
that the Empty House was a forbidden land.
The children of their own accord declared it
out of bounds, and avoided it as carefully as
if all the wild animals from the Zoo were
roaming its gardens, hungry and unchained.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="chapsub">THE SHOCK</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> immediate result of Miss Lake's indiscretion
was that the children preferred to play
on the other side of the garden, the side
farthest from the Empty House. A spiked
railing here divided them from a field in which
cows disported themselves, and as bulls also
sometimes were admitted to the cows, the
field was strictly out of bounds.</p>

<p>In this spiked railing, not far from the
great shrubberies where the Indians increased
and multiplied, there was a swinging gate.
The children swung on it whenever they could.
They called it Express Trains, and the fact
that it was forbidden only added to their
pleasure. When opened at its widest it would
swing them with a rush through the air, past
the pillars with a click, out into the field,
and then back again into the garden. It was
bad for the hinges, and it was also bad for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
garden, because it was frequently left open
after these carnivals, and the cows got in and
trod the flowers down. The children were
not afraid of the cows, but they held the bull
in great horror. And these trivial things have
been mentioned here because of the part they
played in Jimbo's subsequent adventures.</p>

<p>It was only ten days or so after Miss Lake's
sudden departure when Jimbo managed one
evening to elude the vigilance of his lawful
guardians, and wandered off unnoticed among
the laburnums on the front lawn. From the
laburnums he passed successfully to the first
laurel shrubbery, and thence he executed a
clever flank movement and entered the
carriage drive in the rear. The rest was easy,
and he soon found himself at the Lodge gate.</p>

<p>For some moments he peered through the
iron grating, and pondered on the seductiveness
of the dusty road and of the ditch beyond.
To his surprise he found, presently, that the
gate was moving outwards; it was yielding
to his weight. One thing leads easily to
another sometimes, and the open gate led
easily on to the seductive road. The result
was that a minute later Jimbo was chasing
butterflies along the green lane, and throwing
stones into the water of the ditch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p><p>It was the evening of a hot summer's day,
and the butterflies were still out in force.
Jimbo's delight was intense. The joy of
finding himself alone where he had no right
to be put everything else out of his head, and
for some time he wandered on, oblivious of
all but the intoxicating sense of freedom and
the difficulty of choosing between so many
butterflies and such a magnificently dirty ditch.</p>

<p>At first he yielded to the seductions of the
ditch. He caught a big, sleepy beetle and
put it on a violet leaf, and sent it sailing out
to sea; and when it landed on the farther
shore he found a still bigger leaf, and sent it
forth on a voyage in another direction, with
a cargo of daisy petals, and a hairy caterpillar
for a bo'sun's mate. But, just as the vessel
was getting under way, a butterfly of amazing
brilliance floated past insolently under his
very nose. Leaving the beetle and the caterpillar
to navigate the currents as best they
could, he at once gave chase. Cap in hand,
he flew after the butterfly down the lane, and
a dozen times when his cap was just upon
it, it sailed away sideways without the least
effort and escaped him.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the lane took a familiar
turning; the ditch stopped abruptly; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
hedge on his right fell away altogether; the
butterfly danced out of sight into a field,
and Jimbo found himself face to face with
the one thing in the whole world that could,
at that time, fill him with abject terror&mdash;the
Empty House.</p>

<p>He came to a full stop in the middle of the
road and stared up at the windows. He
realised for the first time that he was alone,
and that it was possible for brilliant sunshine,
even on a cloudless day, to become somehow
lustreless and dull. The walls showed a deep
red in the sunset light. The house was still
as the grave. His feet were rooted to the
ground, and it seemed as if he could not move
a single muscle; and as he stood there, the
blood ebbing quickly from his heart, the words
of the governess a few days before rushed
back into his mind, and turned his fear into
a dreadful, all-possessing horror. In another
minute the battered door would slowly open
and the horrible Inmate come out to seize
him. Already there was a sound of something
moving within, and as he gazed, fascinated
with terror, a shuddering movement ran over
the ivy leaves hanging down from the roof.
Then they parted in the middle, and something&mdash;he
could not in his agony see what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&mdash;flew
out with a whirring sound into his face,
and then vanished over his shoulder towards
the fields.</p>

<p>Jimbo did not pause a single second to find
out what it was, or to reflect that any ordinary
thrush would have made just the same sound.
The shock it gave to his heart immediately
loosened the muscles of his little legs, and he
ran for his very life. But before he actually
began to run he gave one piercing scream for
help, and the person he screamed to was the
very person who was unwittingly the cause of
his distress. It was as though he knew
instinctively that the person who had created
for him the terror of the Empty House, with
its horrible Inmate, was also the person who
could properly banish it, and undo the mischief
before it was too late. He shrieked for
help to the governess, Miss Ethel Lake.</p>

<p>Of course, there was no answer but the
noise of the air whistling in his ears as his
feet flew over the road in a cloud of dust;
there was no friendly butcher's cart, no baker's
boy, or farmer with his dog and gun; the
road was deserted. There was not even the
beetle or the caterpillar; he was beyond
reach of help.</p>

<p>Jimbo ran for his life, but unfortunately he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ran in the wrong direction. Instead of going
the way he had come, where the Lodge gates
were ready to receive him not a quarter of a
mile away, he fled in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>It so happened that the lane flanked the
field where the cows lived; but cows were
nothing compared to a Creature from the
Empty House, and even bulls seemed friendly.
The boy was over the five-barred gate in a
twinkling and half-way across the field before
he heard a heavy, thunderous sound behind
him. Either the Thing had followed him into
the field, or it was the bull. As he raced, he
managed to throw a glance over his shoulder
and saw a huge, dark mass bearing down upon
him at terrific speed. It must be the bull, he
reflected&mdash;the bull grown to the size of an elephant.
And it appeared to him to have two
immense black wings that flapped at its sides
and helped it forward, making a whirring
noise like the arms of a great windmill.</p>

<p>This sight added to his speed, but he could
not last very much longer. Already his body
ached all over, and the frantic effort to get
breath nearly choked him.</p>

<p>There, before him, not so very far away
now, was the swinging gate. If only he
could get there in time to scramble over into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the garden, he would be safe. It seemed
almost impossible, and behind him, meanwhile,
the sound of the following creature came
closer and closer; the ground seemed to
tremble; he could almost feel the breath on
his neck.</p>

<p>The swinging gate was only twenty yards
off; now ten; now only five. Now he had
reached it&mdash;at last. He stretched out his
hands to seize the top bar, and in another
moment he would have been safe in the garden
and within easy reach of the house. But,
before he actually touched the iron rail, a
sharp, stinging pain shot across his back;&mdash;he
drew one final breath as he felt himself being
lifted, lifted up into the air. The horns had
caught him just behind the shoulders!</p>

<p>There seemed to be no pain after the first
shock. He rose high into the air, while the
bushes and spiked railing he knew so well
sank out of sight beneath him, dwindling
curiously in size. At first he thought his head
must bump against the sky, but suddenly he
stopped rising, and the green earth rushed up
as if it would strike him in the face. This
meant he was sinking again. The gate and
railing flew by underneath him, and the next
second he fell with a crash upon the soft grass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the lawn&mdash;upon the other side. He had
been tossed over the gate into the garden, and
the bull could no longer reach him.</p>

<p>Before he became wholly unconscious, a composite
picture, vivid in its detail, engraved
itself deeply, with exceeding swiftness, line by
line, upon the waxen tablets of his mind. In
this picture the thrush that had flown out of
the ivy, the Empty House itself, and its
horrible, pursuing Inmate were all somehow
curiously mingled together with the black
wings of the bull, and with his own sensation
of rushing&mdash;flying headlong&mdash;through space,
as he rose and fell in a curve from the
creature's horns.</p>

<p>And behind it he was conscious that the
real author of it all was somewhere in the
shadowy background, looking on as though
to watch the result of her unfortunate mistake.
Miss Lake, surely, was not very far away.
He associated her with the horror of the
Empty House as inevitably as taste and smell
join together in the memory of a certain food;
and the very last thought in his mind, as he
sank away into the blackness of unconsciousness,
was a sort of bitter surprise that the
governess had not turned up to save him
before it was actually too late.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p><p>Moreover, a certain sense of disappointment
mingled with the terror of the shock; for he
was dimly aware that Miss Lake had not
acted as worthily as she might have done,
and had not played the game as well as might
have been expected of her. And, somehow,
it didn't all seem quite fair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="chapsub">ON THE EDGE OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimbo</span> had fallen on his head. Inside that
head lay the mass of highly sensitive matter
called the brain, on which were recorded, of
course, the impressions of everything that had
yet come to him in life. A severe shock, such
as he had just sustained, was bound to throw
these impressions into confusion and disorder,
jumbling them up into new and strange combinations,
obliterating some, and exaggerating
others. Jimbo himself was helpless in the
matter; he could exercise no control over
their antics until the doctors had once again
reduced them to order; he would have to
wander, lost and lonely, through the comparative
chaos of disproportioned visions,
generally known as the region of delirium, until
the doctor, assisted by mother nature, restored
him once more to normal consciousness.</p>

<p>For a time everything was a blank, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
presently he stirred uneasily in the grass, and
the pictures graven on the tablets of his mind
began to come back to him line by line.</p>

<p>Yet, with certain changes: the bull, for
instance, had so far vanished into the background
of his thoughts that it had practically
disappeared altogether, and he recalled nothing
of it but the wings&mdash;the huge, flapping wings.
Of the creature to whom the wings belonged
he had no recollection beyond that it was very
large, and that it was chasing him from the
Empty House. The pain in his shoulders had
also gone; but what remained with undiminished
vividness were the sensations of
flight without escape, the breathless race up
into the sky, and the swift, tumbling drop
again through the air on to the lawn.</p>

<p>This impression of rushing through space&mdash;short
though the actual distance had been&mdash;was
the dominating memory. All else was
apparently oblivion. He forgot where he
came from, and he forgot what he had been
doing. The events leading up to the catastrophe,
indeed everything connected with his
existence previously as "Master James," had
entirely vanished; and the slate of memory
had been wiped so clean that he had forgotten
even his own name!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p><p>Jimbo was lying, so to speak, on the edge
of unconsciousness, and for a time it seemed
uncertain whether he would cross the line into
the region of delirium and dreams, or fall back
again into his natural world. Terror, assisted
by the horns of the black bull, had tossed him
into the borderland.</p>

<p>His last scream, however, had reached the
ears of the ubiquitous gardener, and help was
near at hand. He heard voices that seemed
to come from beyond the stars, and was aware
that shadowy forms were standing over him
and talking in whispers. But it was all very
unreal; one minute the voices sounded up
in the sky, and the next in his very ears,
while the figures moved about, sometimes
bending over him, sometimes retreating and
melting away like shadows on a shifting
screen.</p>

<p>Suddenly a blaze of light flashed upon him,
and his eyes flew open; he tumbled back for
a moment into his normal world. He wasn't
on the grass at all, but was lying upon his own
bed in the night nursery. His mother was
bending over him with a very white face, and
a tall man dressed in black stood beside her,
holding some kind of shining instrument in
his fingers. A little behind them he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Nixie, shading a lamp with her hand. Then
the white face came close over the pillow, and
a voice full of tenderness whispered,
"My darling boy, don't you know me?
It's mother! No one will hurt you. Speak
to me, if you can, dear."</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands, and Jimbo
knew her and made an effort to answer. But
it seemed to him as if his whole body had
suddenly become a solid mass of iron, and he
could control no part of it; his lips and his
hands both refused to move. Before he could
make a sign that he had understood and was
trying to reply, a fierce flame rushed between
them and blinded him, his eyes closed, and
he dropped back again into utter darkness.
The walls flew asunder and the ceiling melted
into air, while the bed sank away beneath him,
down, down, down into an abyss of shadows.
The lamp in Nixie's hands dwindled into a
star, and his mother's anxious face became a
tiny patch of white in the distance, blurred
out of all semblance of a human countenance.
For a time the man in black seemed to hover
over the bed as it sank, as though he were
trying to follow it down; but it, too, presently
joined the general enveloping blackness
and lost its outline. The pain had blotted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
out everything, and the return to consciousness
had been only momentary.</p>

<p>Not all the doctors in the world could have
made things otherwise. Jimbo was off on his
travels at last&mdash;travels in which the chief
incidents were directly traceable to the causes
and details of his accident: the terror of the
Empty House, the pursuit of its Inmate, the
pain of the bull's horns, and, above all, the
flight through the air.</p>

<p>For everything in his subsequent adventures
found its inspiration in the events described,
and a singular parallel ran ever between the
Jimbo upon the bed in the night-nursery and
the other emancipated Jimbo wandering in
the regions of unconsciousness and delirium.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="chapsub">INTO THE EMPTY HOUSE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> darkness lasted a long time without a
break, and when it lifted all recollection of
the bedroom scene had vanished.</p>

<p>Jimbo found himself back again on the grass.
The swinging gate was just in front of him,
but he did not recognise it; no suggestion of
"Express Trains" came back to him as his
eyes rested without remembrance upon the
bars where he had so often swung, in defiance
of orders, with his brothers and sisters.
Recollection of his home, family, and previous
life he had absolutely none; or at least, it
was buried so deeply in his inner consciousness
that it amounted to the same thing, and he
looked out upon the garden, the gate, and the
field beyond as upon an entirely new piece of
the world.</p>

<p>The stars, he saw, were nearly all gone, and
a very faint light was beginning to spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from the woods beyond the field. The eastern
horizon was slowly brightening, and soon the
night would be gone. Jimbo was glad of
this. He began to be conscious of little thrills
of expectation, for with the light surely help
would also come. The light always brought
relief, and he already felt that strange excitement
that comes with the first signs of dawn.
In the distance cocks were crowing, horses
began to stamp in the barns not far away, and
a hundred little stirrings of life ran over
the surface of the earth as the light crept
slowly up the sky and dropped down again
upon the world with its message of coming
day.</p>

<p>Of course, help would come by the time the
sun was really up, and it was partly this
certainty, and partly because he was a little
too dazed to realise the seriousness of the
situation, that prevented his giving way to
a fit of fear and weeping. Yet a feeling of
vague terror lay only a little way below the
surface, and when, a few moments later, he
saw that he was no longer alone, and that
an odd-looking figure was creeping towards
him from the shrubberies, he sprang to his
feet, prepared to run unless it at once showed
the most friendly intentions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p><p>This figure seemed to have come from nowhere.
Apparently it had risen out of the
earth. It was too large to have been concealed
by the low shrubberies; yet he had
not been aware of its approach, and it had
appeared without making any noise. Probably
it was friendly, he felt, in spite of its
curious shape and the stealthy way it had
come. At least, he hoped so; and if he
could only have told whether it was a man or
an animal he would easily have made up his
mind. But the uncertain light, and the way
it crouched half-hidden behind the bushes,
prevented this. So he stood, poised ready
to run, and yet waiting, hoping, indeed
expecting every minute a sign of friendliness
and help.</p>

<p>In this way the two faced each other
silently for some time, until the feeling of
terror gradually stole deeper into the boy's
heart and began to rob him of full power over
his muscles. He wondered if he would be
able to run when the time came, and whether
he could run fast enough. This was how it
first showed itself, this suggestion of insidious
fear. Would he be able to keep up the start
he had? Would it chase him? Would it
run like a man or like an animal, on four legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
or on two? He wished he could see more
clearly what it was. He still stood his ground
pluckily, facing it and waiting, but the fear,
once admitted to his mind, was gaining
strength, and he began to feel cold and shivery.
Then suddenly the tension came to an end.
In two strides the figure came up close to his
side, and the same second Jimbo was lifted off
his feet and borne swiftly away across the field.</p>

<p>He felt quite unable to offer the least
resistance, and at the same time he felt a sense
of relief that something had happened at last.
He was still not sure that the figure was
unkind; only its shape filled him with a
feeling that was certainly the beginning of real
horror. It was the shape of a man, he thought,
but of a very large and ill-constructed man;
for it certainly had moved on two legs and
had caught him up in a pair of tremendously
strong arms. But there was something else
it had besides arms, for a kind of soft cloak
hung all round it and wrapped the boy from
head to foot, preventing him seeing his captor
properly, and at the same time filling his body
with a kind of warm drowsiness that mitigated
his active fear and made him rather like the
sensation of being carried along so easily and
so fast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p><p>But was he being carried? The pace they
were going was amazing, and he moved as
easily as a sailing boat, and with the same
swinging motion. Could it be some animal
like a horse after all? Jimbo tried to see
more, but found it impossible to free himself
from the folds of the enveloping substance,
and meanwhile they were swinging forward at
what seemed a tremendous pace over fields
and ditches, through hedges, and down long
lanes.</p>

<p>The odours of earth, and dew-drenched
grass, and opening flowers came to him. He
heard the birds singing, and felt the cool
morning air sting his cheeks as they raced
along. There was no jolting or jarring, and
the figure seemed to cover the ground as lightly
as though it hardly touched the earth. It
was certainly not a dream, he was sure of that;
but the longer they went on the drowsier he
became, and the less he wondered whether
the figure was going to help him or to do
something dreadful to him. He was now
thoroughly afraid, and yet, strange contradiction,
he didn't care a bit. Let the figure
do what it liked; it was only a sort of nightmare
person after all, and might vanish as
suddenly as it had arrived.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p><p>For a long time they raced forward at this
great speed, and then with a bump and a
crash they stopped suddenly short, and Jimbo
felt himself let down upon the solid earth.
He tried to free himself at once from the
folds of the clinging substance that enveloped
him, but, before he could do so and see what
his captor was really like, he heard a door
slam and felt himself pushed along what
seemed to be the hallways of a house. His
eyes were clear now and he could see, but the
darkness had come down again so thickly
that all he could discover was that the figure
was urging him along the floor of a large
empty hall, and that they were in a dark and
empty building.</p>

<p>Jimbo tried hard to see his captor, but the
figure, dim enough in the uncertain light,
always managed to hide its face and keep
itself bunched up in such a way that he could
never see more than a great, dark mass of a
body, from which long legs and arms shot out
like telescopes, draped in a sort of clinging
cloak. Now that the rapid motion through
the air had ceased, the boy's drowsiness passed
a little, and he began to shiver with fear and
to feel that the tears could not be kept back
much longer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p><p>Probably in another minute he would have
started to run for his life, when a new sound
caught his ears and made him listen intently,
while a feeling of wonder and delight caught
his heart, and made him momentarily forget
the figure pushing him forward from behind.</p>

<p>Was it the wind he heard? Or was it the
voices of children all singing together very
low? It was a gentle, sighing sound that
rose and fell with mournful modulations and
seemed to come from the very centre of the
building; it held, too, a strange, far-away
murmur, like the surge of a faint breeze moving
in the tree-tops. It might be the wind
playing round the walls of the building, or it
might be children singing in hushed voices.
One minute he thought it was outside the
house, and the next he was certain it came
from somewhere in the upper part of the
building. He glanced up, and fancied for one
moment that he saw in the darkness a crowd
of little faces peering down at him over the
banisters, and that as they disappeared he
heard the sound of many little feet moving,
and then a door hurriedly closing. But a
push from the figure behind that nearly sent
him sprawling at the foot of the stairs, prevented
his hearing very clearly, and the light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was far too dim to let him feel sure of what
he had seen.</p>

<p>They passed quickly along deserted corridors
and through winding passages. No one
seemed about. The interior of the house was
chilly, and the keen air nipped. After going
up several flights of stairs they stopped at last
in front of a door, and before Jimbo had a
moment to turn and dash downstairs again
past the figure, as he had meant to do, he was
pushed violently forward into a room.</p>

<p>The door slammed after him, and he heard
the heavy tread of the figure as it went down
the staircase again into the bottom of the
house. Then he saw that the room was full
of light and of small moving beings.</p>

<p>Curiosity and astonishment now for a
moment took the place of fear, and Jimbo,
with a thumping heart and clenched fists,
stood and stared at the scene before him. He
stiffened his little legs and leaned against the
wall for support, but he felt full of fight in
case anything happened, and with wide-open
eyes he tried to take in the whole scene at
once and be ready for whatever might come.</p>

<p>But there seemed no immediate cause for
alarm, and when he realised that the beings
in the room were apparently children, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
only children, his rather mixed sensations of
astonishment and fear gave place to an emotion
of overpowering shyness. He became exceedingly
embarrassed, for he was surrounded by
children of all ages and sizes, staring at him
just as hard as he was staring at them.</p>

<p>The children, he began to take in, were all
dressed in black; they looked frightened and
unhappy; their bodies were thin and their
faces very white. There was something else
about them he could not quite name, but it
inspired him with the same sense of horror
that he had felt in the arms of the Figure who
had trapped him. For he now realised
definitely that he had been trapped; and he
also began to realise for the first time that,
though he still had the body of a little boy,
his way of thinking and judging was sometimes
more like that of a grown-up person.
The two alternated, and the result was an odd
confusion; for sometimes he felt like a child
and thought like a man, while at others he
felt like a man and thought like a child.
Something had gone wrong, very much
wrong; and, as he watched this group of
silent children facing him, he knew suddenly
that what was just beginning to happen to
him <em>had happened to them long, long ago</em>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p><p>For they looked as if they had been a long,
long time in the world, yet their bodies had
not kept pace with their minds. Something
had happened to stop the growth of the body,
while allowing the mind to go on developing.
The bodies were not stunted or deformed;
they were well-formed, nice little children's
bodies, but the minds within them were
grown-up, and the incongruity was distressing.
All this he suddenly realised in a flash, intuitively,
just as though it had been most
elaborately explained to him; yet he could
not have put the least part of it into words
or have explained what he saw and felt to
another.</p>

<p>He saw that they had the hands and figures
of children, the heads of children, the unlined
faces and smooth foreheads of children, but
their gestures, and something in their movements,
belonged to grown-up people, and the
expression of their eyes in meaning and
intelligence was the expression of old people
and not of children. And the expression in
the eyes of every one of them he saw was the
expression of terror and of pain. The effect
was so singular that he seemed face to face
with an entirely new order of creatures: a
child's features with a man's eyes; a child's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
figure with a woman's movements; full-grown
souls cramped and cribbed in absurdly
inadequate bodies and little, puny frames;
the old trying uncouthly to express itself in
the young.</p>

<p>The grown-up, old portion of him had been
uppermost as he stared and received these
impressions, but now suddenly it passed away,
and he felt as a little boy again. He glanced
quickly down at his own little body in the
alpaca knickerbockers and sailor blouse, and
then, with a sigh of relief, looked up again at
the strange group facing him. So far, at any
rate, he had not changed, and there was
nothing yet to suggest that he was becoming
like them in appearance at least.</p>

<p>With his back against the door he faced the
roomful of children who stood there motionless
and staring; and as he looked, wild feelings
rushed over him and made him tremble. Who
was he? Where had he come from? Where
in the world had he spent the other years of
his life, the forgotten years? There seemed
to be no one to whom he could go for comfort,
no one to answer questions; and there was
such a lot he wanted to ask. He seemed to
be so much older, and to know so much more
than he ought to have known, and yet to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
have forgotten so much that he ought not to
have forgotten.</p>

<p>His loss of memory, however, was of course
only partial. He had forgotten his own
identity, and all the people with whom he
had so far in life had to do; yet at the same
time he was dimly conscious that he had just
left all these people, and that some day he
would find them again. It was only the
surface-layers of memory that had vanished,
and these had not vanished for ever, but only
sunk down a little below the horizon.</p>

<p>Then, presently, the children began to range
themselves in rows between him and the
opposite wall, without once taking their
horrible, intelligent eyes off him as they moved.
He watched them with growing dread, but at
last his curiosity became so strong that it
overcame everything else, and in a voice that
he meant to be very brave, but that sounded
hardly above a whisper, he said:</p>

<p>"Who are you? And what's been done to
you?"</p>

<p>The answer came at once in a whisper as
low as his own, though he could not distinguish
who spoke:</p>

<p>"Listen and you shall know. You, too,
are now one of us."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p><p>Immediately the children began a slow,
impish sort of dance before him, moving almost
with silent feet over the boards, yet with a
sedateness and formality that had none of the
unconscious grace of children. And, as they
danced, they sang, but in voices so low, that
it was more like the mournful sighing of wind
among branches than human voices. It was the
sound he had already heard outside the building.</p>

<p>The plaintive song and the dance ceased
together, and before Jimbo could find any
words to clothe even one of the thoughts that
crowded through his mind, he saw them
moving towards a door he had not hitherto
noticed on the other side of the room. A
moment later they had opened it and passed
out, sedate, mournful, unhurried; and the
boy found that in some way he could not
understand the light had gone with them,
and he was standing with his back against
the wall in almost total darkness.</p>

<p>Once out of the room, no sound followed
them, and he crossed over and tried the handle
of the door. It was locked. Then he went
back and tried the other door; that, too,
was locked. He was shut in. There was no
longer any doubt as to the Figure's intentions;
he was a prisoner, trapped like an animal in
a cage.</p>

<p>The only thought in his mind just then
was an intense desire for freedom. Whatever
happened he must escape. He crossed the
floor to the only window in the room; it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
without blinds, and he looked out. But
instantly he recoiled with a fresh and overpowering
sense of helplessness, for it was three
storeys from the ground, and down below in
the shadows he saw a paved courtyard that
rendered jumping utterly out of the question.</p>

<p>He stood for a long time, fighting down the
tears, and staring as if his heart would break
at the field and trees beyond. A high wall
enclosed the yard, but beyond that was
freedom and open space. Feelings of loneliness
and helplessness, terror and dismay
overwhelmed him. His eyes burned and
smarted, yet, strange to say, the tears now
refused to come and bring him relief. He
could only stand there with his elbows on the
window-sill, and watch the outline of the trees
and hedges grow clearer and clearer as the
light drew across the sky, and the moment of
sunrise came close.</p>

<p>But when at last he turned back into the
room, he saw that he was no longer alone.
Crouching against the opposite wall there was
a hooded figure steadily watching him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="chapsub">HIS COMPANION IN PRISON</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Shocks</span> of terror, as they increase in number,
apparently lessen in effect; the repeated calls
made upon Jimbo's soul by the emotions of
fear and astonishment had numbed it; otherwise
the knowledge that he was locked in the
room with this mysterious creature beyond
all possibility of escape must have frightened
him, as the saying is, out of his skin.</p>

<p>As it was, however, he kept his head in a
wonderful manner, and simply stared at the
silent intruder as hard as ever he could stare.
How in the world it got in was the principal
thought in his mind, and after that: what in
the world was it?</p>

<p>The dawn must have come very swiftly, or
else he had been staring longer than he knew,
for just then the sun topped the edge of the
world and the window-sill simultaneously, and
sent a welcome ray of sunshine into the dingy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
room. It turned the grey light to silver, and
fell full upon the huddled figure crouching
against the opposite wall. Jimbo caught his
breath, and stared harder than ever.</p>

<p>It was a human figure, the figure, apparently,
of a man, sitting crumpled up in a very uncomfortable
sort of position on his haunches.
It sat perfectly still. A black cloak, with loose
sleeves, and a cowl or hood that completely
concealed the face, covered it from head to
foot. The material of the cloak could not
have been very thick, for inside the hood he
caught the gleam of eyes as they roamed
about the room and followed his movements.
But for this glitter of the moving eyes it might
have been a figure carved in wood. Was it
going to sit there for ever watching him?
At first he was afraid it was going to speak;
then he was afraid it wasn't. It might rise
suddenly and come towards him; yet the
thought that it would not move at all was
worse still.</p>

<p>In this way the two faced each other for
several minutes until, just as the position was
becoming simply unbearable, a low whisper
ran round the room: "At last! Oh! I've
found him at last!" Jimbo was not quite
sure of the words, though it was certainly a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
human voice that had spoken; but, the
suspense once broken, the boy could not stand
it any longer, and with a rush of desperate
courage he found his voice&mdash;a very husky
one&mdash;and moved a step forward.</p>

<p>"Who are you, please, and how <em>did</em> you
get in?" he ventured with a great effort.</p>

<p>Then he fell back against the wall, amazed
at his own daring, and waited with tightly-clenched
fists for an answer. But he had not
to wait very long, for almost immediately the
figure rose awkwardly to its feet, and came
over to where he stood. Its manner of
moving may best be described as shuffling;
and it stretched in front of it a long cloaked
arm, on which the sleeve hung, he thought,
like clothes on a washing line.</p>

<p>He breathed hard, and waited. Like many
other people with strong wills and sensitive
nerves, Jimbo was both brave and a coward:
he hoped nothing horrid was going to happen,
but he was quite ready if it should. Yet,
now that the actual moment had come, he
had no particular fear, and when he felt the
touch of the hand on his shoulder, the words
sprang naturally to his lips with a little
trembling laugh, more of wonder perhaps than
anything else.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p><p>"You do look a horrid ... <em>brute</em>," he was
going to say, but at the last moment he changed
it to "<em>thing</em>," for, with the true intuition of a
child, he recognised that the creature inside
the cloak was a kind creature and well disposed
towards him. "But how did you get
in?" he added, looking up bravely into the
black visage, "because the doors are both
locked on the outside, and I couldn't get out?"</p>

<p>By way of reply the figure shuffled to one
side, and, taking the hand from his shoulder,
pointed silently to a trap-door in the floor
behind him. As he looked, he saw it was being
shut down stealthily by some one beneath.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered the figure, almost
inaudibly. "He's watching!"</p>

<p>"Who's watching?" he cried, curiosity
taking the place of every other emotion.
"I want to see." He ran forward to the spot
where the trap-door now lay flush with the
floor, but, before he had gone two steps, the
black arms shot out and caught him. He
turned, struggling, and in the scuffle that
followed the cloak shrouding the figure became
disarranged; the hood dropped from the face,
and he found himself looking straight into the
eyes, not of a man, but of a woman!</p>

<p>"It's you!" he cried, "<em class="uc">YOU&mdash;!</em>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p><p>A shock ran right through his body from his
head to his feet, like a current of electricity,
and he caught his breath as though he had
been struck. For one brief instant the sinister
face of some one who had terrified him in the
past came back vividly to his mind, and he
shrank away in terror. But it was only for
an instant, the twentieth part of an instant.
Immediately, before he could even remember
the name, recognition passed into darkness and
his memory shut down with a snap. He was
staring into the face of an utter stranger,
about whom he knew nothing and had no
feelings particularly one way or another.</p>

<p>"I thought I knew you," he gasped, "but
I've forgotten you again&mdash;and I thought you
were going to be a man, too."</p>

<p>"Jimbo!" cried the other, and in her voice
was such unmistakable tenderness and yearning
that the boy knew at once beyond doubt
that she was his friend, "Jimbo!"</p>

<p>She knelt down on the floor beside him, so
that her face was on a level with his, and then
opened both her arms to him. But though
Jimbo was glad to have found a friend who
was going to help him, he felt no particular
desire to be embraced, and he stood obstinately
where he was with his back to the window.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p><p>The morning sunshine fell upon her features
and touched the thick coils of her hair with
glory. It was not, strictly speaking, a pretty
face, but the look of real human tenderness
there was very welcome and comforting, and
in the kind brown eyes there shone a strange
light that was not merely the reflection of the
sunlight. The boy felt his heart warm to
her as he looked, but her expression puzzled
him, and he would not accept the invitation
of her arms.</p>

<p>"Won't you come to me?" she said, her
arms still outstretched.</p>

<p>"I want to know who you are, and what
I'm doing here," he said. "I feel so funny&mdash;so
old and so young&mdash;and all mixed up. I
can't make out who I am a bit. What's that
funny name you call me?"</p>

<p>"Jimbo is your name," she said softly.</p>

<p>"Then what's <em>your</em> name?" he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>"My name," she repeated slowly after a
pause, "is not&mdash;as nice as yours. Besides,
you need not know my name&mdash;you might
dislike it."</p>

<p>"But I must have something to call you,"
he persisted.</p>

<p>"But if I told you, and you disliked the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
name, you might dislike <em>me</em> too," she said,
still hesitating.</p>

<p>Jimbo saw the expression of sadness in her
eyes, and it won his confidence though he
hardly knew why. He came up closer to her
and put his puzzled little face next to hers.</p>

<p>"I like you very much already," he
whispered, "and if your name is a horrid one
I'll change it for you at once. Please tell me
what it is."</p>

<p>She drew the boy to her and gave him a little
hug, and he did not resist. For a long time
she did not answer. He felt vaguely that
something of dreadful importance hung about
this revelation of her name. He repeated his
question, and at length she replied, speaking
in a very low voice, and with her eyes fixed
intently upon his face.</p>

<p>"My name," she said, "is Ethel Lake."</p>

<p>"Ethel Lake," he repeated after her. The
words sounded somehow familiar to him;
surely he had heard that name before. Were
not the words associated with something in
his past that had been unpleasant? A curious
sinking sensation came over him as he heard
them.</p>

<p>His companion watched him intently while
he repeated the words over to himself several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
times, as if to make sure he had got them
right. There was a moment's hesitation as
he slowly went over them once again. Then
he turned to her, laughing.</p>

<p>"I like your name, Ethel Lake," he said.
"It's a nice name&mdash;Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;" Again
he hesitated, while a little warning tremor ran
through his mind, and he wondered for an
instant why he said "Miss." But it passed
as suddenly as it had come, and he finished
the sentence&mdash;"Miss Lake, I shall call you."
He stared into her eyes as he said it.</p>

<p>"Then you don't remember me at all?"
she cried, with a sigh of intense relief. "You've
quite forgotten?"</p>

<p>"I never saw you before, did I? How
can I remember you? I don't remember any
of the things I've forgotten. Are you one of
them?"</p>

<p>For reply she caught him to her breast and
kissed him. "You precious little boy!" she
said. "I'm so glad, oh, so glad!"</p>

<p>"But do you remember <em>me</em>?" he asked,
sorely puzzled. "Who am I? Haven't I
been born yet, or something funny like that?"</p>

<p>"If you don't remember <em>me</em>," said the other,
her face happy with smiles that had evidently
come only just in time to prevent tears,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
"there's not much good telling you who <em>you</em>
are. But your name, if you really want to
know, is&mdash;&mdash;" She hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"Be quick, Eth&mdash;Miss Lake, or you'll forget
it again."</p>

<p>She laughed rather bitterly. "Oh, I never
forget. I can't!" she said. "I wish I could.
Your name is James Stone, and Jimbo is
'short' for James. Now you know."</p>

<p>She might just as well have said Bill Sykes
for all the boy knew or remembered.</p>

<p>"What a silly name!" he laughed. "But
it can't be my real name, or I should know it.
I never heard it before." After a moment he
added, "Am I an old man? I feel just like
one. I suppose I'm grown up&mdash;grown up so
fast that I've forgotten what came before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're not grown up, dear, at least, not
exactly&mdash;&mdash;" She glanced down at his alpaca
knickerbockers and brown stockings; and as
he followed her eyes and saw the dirty buttoned-boots
there came into his mind some dim
memory of where he had last put them on,
and of some one who had helped him. But
it all passed like a swift meteor across the dark
night of his forgetfulness and was lost in mist.</p>

<p>"You mustn't judge by these silly clothes,"
he laughed. "I shall change them as soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
as I get&mdash;as soon as I can find&mdash;&mdash;" He
stopped short. No words came. A feeling of
utter loneliness and despair swept suddenly
over him, drenching him from head to foot.
He felt lost and friendless, naked, homeless,
cold. He was ever on the brink of regaining
a whole lot of knowledge and experience that
he had known once long ago, ever so long ago,
but it always kept just out of his reach. He
glanced at Miss Lake, feeling that she was his
only possible comfort in a terrible situation.
She met his look and drew him tenderly towards
her.</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me," she said gently, "I've
something to tell you&mdash;about myself."</p>

<p>He was all attention in a minute.</p>

<p>"I am a discharged governess," she began,
holding her breath when once the words were
out.</p>

<p>"Discharged!" he repeated vaguely.
"What's that? What for?"</p>

<p>"For frightening a child. I told a little
boy awful stories that weren't true. They
terrified him so much that I was sent away.
That's why I'm here now. It's my punishment.
I am a prisoner here until I can find
him&mdash;and help him to escape&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" he exclaimed quickly, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
though remembering something. But it
passed, and he looked up at her half-bored,
half-politely. "Escape from what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"From here. This is the Empty House I
told the stories about; <em>and you are the little
boy I frightened</em>. Now, at last, I've found you,
and am going to save you." She paused,
watching him with eyes that never left his
face for an instant.</p>

<p>Jimbo was delighted to hear he was going
to be rescued, but he felt no interest at all in
her story of having frightened a little boy, who
was himself. He thought it was very nice of
her to take so much trouble, and he told her
so, and when he went up and kissed her and
thanked her, he saw to his surprise that she
was crying. For the life of him he could not
understand why a discharged governess whom
he met, apparently, for the first time in the
Empty House, should weep over him and
show him so much affection. But he could
think of nothing to say, so he just waited till
she had finished.</p>

<p>"You see, if I can save you," she said
between her sobs, "it will be all right again,
and I shall be forgiven, and shall be able to
escape with you. I want you to escape, so
that you can get back to life again."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p><p>"Oh, then I'm dead, am I?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly dead," she said, drying her
eyes with the corner of her black hood.
"You've had a funny accident, you know.
If your body gets all right, so that you can go
back and live in it again, then you're not dead.
But if it's so badly injured that you can't
work in it any more, then you are dead, and
will have to stay dead. You're still joined
to the body in a fashion, you see."</p>

<p>He stared and listened, not understanding
much. It all bored him. She talked without
explaining, he thought. An immense sponge
had passed over the slate of the past and
wiped it clean beyond recall. He was utterly
perplexed.</p>

<p>"How funny you are!" he said vaguely,
thinking more of her tears than her explanations.</p>

<p>"Water won't stay in a cracked bottle,"
she went on, "and you can't stay in a broken
body. But they're trying to mend it now,
and if we can escape in time you can be an
ordinary, happy little boy in the world again."</p>

<p>"Then are you dead, too?" he asked, "or
nearly dead?"</p>

<p>"I am out of my body, like you," she
answered evasively, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p><p>He was still looking at her in a dazed sort
of way, when she suddenly sprang to her feet
and let the hood drop back over her face.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, "he's listening
again."</p>

<p>At the same moment a sound came from
beneath the floor on the other side of the
room, and Jimbo saw the trap-door being
slowly raised above the level of the floor.</p>

<p>"Your number is 102," said a voice that
sounded like the rushing of a river.</p>

<p>Instantly the trap-door dropped again, and
he heard heavy steps rumbling away into the
interior of the house. He looked at his companion
and saw her terrified face as she lifted
her hood.</p>

<p>"He always blunders along like that," she
whispered, bending her head on one side to
listen. "He can't see properly in the daylight.
He hates sunshine, and usually only goes
out after dark." She was white and trembling.</p>

<p>"Is that the person who brought me in here
this morning at such a frightful pace?" he
asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>She nodded. "He wanted to get in before
it was light, so that you couldn't see his face."</p>

<p>"Is he such a fright?" asked the boy, beginning
to share her evident feeling of horror.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>"He <em>is</em> Fright!" she said in an awed
whisper. "But never talk about him again
unless you can't help it; he always knows
when he's being talked about, and he likes it,
because it gives him more power."</p>

<p>Jimbo only stared at her without comprehending.
Then his mind jumped to something
else he wanted badly to have explained,
and he asked her about his number, and why
he was called No. 102.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easier," she said, "102 is your
number among the Frightened Children;
there are 101 of them, and you are the last
arrival. Haven't you seen them yet? It is
also the temperature of your broken little
body lying on the bed in the night nursery at
home," she added, though he hardly caught
her words, so low were they spoken.</p>

<p>Jimbo then described how the children had
sung and danced to him, and went on to ask
a hundred questions about them. But Miss
Lake would give him very little information,
and said he would not have very much to do
with them. Most of them had been in the
House for years and years&mdash;so long that they
could probably never escape at all.</p>

<p>"They are all frightened children," she
said. "Little ones scared out of their wits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
by silly people who meant to amuse them
with stories, or to frighten them into being
well behaved&mdash;nursery-maids, elder sisters,
and even governesses!"</p>

<p>"And they can never escape?"</p>

<p>"Not unless the people who frightened them
come to their rescue and <em>run the risk of being
caught themselves</em>."</p>

<p>As she spoke there rose from the depths of
the house the sound of muffled voices, children's
voices singing faintly together; it rose and
fell exactly like the wind, and with as little
tune; it was weird and magical, but so
utterly mournful that the boy felt the tears
start to his eyes. It drifted away, too, just as
the wind does over the tops of the trees, dying
into the distance; and all became still again.</p>

<p>"It's just like the wind," he said, "and I
do love the wind. It makes me feel so sad
and so happy. Why is it?"</p>

<p>The governess did not answer.</p>

<p>"How old am I <em>really</em>?" he went on.
"How can I be so old and so ignorant? I've
forgotten such an awful lot of knowledge."</p>

<p>"The fact is&mdash;well, perhaps, you won't
quite understand&mdash;but you're really two ages
at once. Sometimes you feel as old as your
body, and sometimes as old as your soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
You're still connected with your body; so
you get the sensations of both mixed up."</p>

<p>"Then is the body younger than the soul?"</p>

<p>"The soul&mdash;that is yourself," she answered,
"is, oh, so old, awfully old, as old as the
stars, and older. But the body is no older
than itself&mdash;of course, how could it be?"</p>

<p>"Of course," repeated the boy, who was
not listening to a word she said. "How
could it be?"</p>

<p>"But it doesn't matter how old you are
or how young you feel, as long as you don't
hate me for having frightened you," she said
after a pause. "That's the chief thing."</p>

<p>He was very, very puzzled. He could not
help feeling it had been rather unkind of her
to frighten him so badly that he had literally
been frightened out of his skin; but he couldn't
remember anything about it, and she was
taking so much trouble to save him now that he
quite forgave her. He nestled up against her,
and said of course he liked her, and she stroked
his curly head and mumbled a lot of things
to herself that he couldn't understand a bit.</p>

<p>But in spite of his new-found friend the
feeling of over-mastering loneliness would
suddenly rush over him. She might be a
protector, but she was not a <em>real</em> companion;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and he knew that somewhere or other he had
left a lot of other <em>real</em> companions whom he
now missed dreadfully. He longed more than
he could say for freedom; he wanted to be
able to come and go as he pleased; to play
about in a garden somewhere as of old; to
wander over soft green lawns among laburnums
and sweet-smelling lilac trees, and to be up
to all his old tricks and mischief&mdash;though he
could not remember in detail what they were.</p>

<p>In a word, he wanted to escape; his whole
being yearned to escape and be free again;
yet here he was a wretched prisoner in a room
like a prison-cell, with a sort of monster for
a keeper, and a troop of horrible frightened
children somewhere else in the house to keep
him company. And outside there was only
a hard, narrow, paved courtyard with a high
wall round it. Oh, it was too terrible to think
of, and his heart sank down within him till
he felt as if he could do nothing else but cry.</p>

<p>"I shall save you in time," whispered the
governess, as though she read his thoughts.
"You must be patient, and do what I tell
you, and I promise to get you out. Only be
brave, and don't ask too many questions. We
shall win in the end and escape."</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up, with quite a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
expression in his face. "But I say, Miss
Cake, I'm frightfully hungry. I've had
nothing to eat since&mdash;I can't remember when,
but ever so long ago."</p>

<p>"You needn't call me Miss Cake, though,"
she laughed.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's because I'm so hungry."</p>

<p>"Then you'll call me Miss Lake when you're
thirsty, perhaps," she said. "But, anyhow,
I'll see what I can get you. Only, you must
eat as little as possible. I want you to get
very thin. What you feel is not really
hunger&mdash;it's only a memory of hunger, and
you'll soon get used to it."</p>

<p>He stared at her with a very distressful
little face as she crossed the room making this
new announcement; and just as she disappeared
through the trap-door, only her head
being visible, she added with great emphasis,
"The thinner you get the better; because
the thinner you are the lighter you are, and
the lighter you are the easier it will be to
escape. Remember, the thinner the better&mdash;the
lighter the better&mdash;and don't ask a lot of
questions about it."</p>

<p>With that the trap-door closed over her,
and Jimbo was left alone with her last strange
words ringing in his ears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="chapsub">THE SPELL OF THE EMPTY HOUSE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not long before Jimbo realised that
the House, and everything connected with it,
spelt for him one message, and one only&mdash;a
message of fear. From the first day of his
imprisonment the forces of his whole being
shaped themselves without further ado into
one intense, single, concentrated desire to
<em>escape</em>.</p>

<p>Freedom, escape into the world beyond
that terrible high wall, was his only object,
and Miss Lake, the governess, as its symbol,
was his only hope. He asked a lot of questions
and listened to a lot of answers, but all he
really cared about was how he was going to
escape, and when. All her other explanations
were tedious, and he only half-listened to them.
His faith in her was absolute, his patience
unbounded; she had come to save him, and
he knew that before long she would accomplish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
her end. He felt a blind and perfect confidence.
But, meanwhile, his fear of the
House, and his horror for the secret Being
who meant to keep him prisoner till at length
he became one of the troop of Frightened
Children, increased by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>Presently the trap-door creaked again, and
the governess reappeared; in her hand was a
small white jug and a soup plate.</p>

<p>"Thin gruel and skim milk," she explained,
pouring out a substance like paste into the
soup plate, and handing him a big wooden
spoon.</p>

<p>But Jimbo's hunger had somehow vanished.</p>

<p>"It wasn't real hunger," she told him,
"but only a sort of memory of being hungry.
They're trying to feed your broken body now
in the night-nursery, and so you feel a sort
of ghostly hunger here even though you're
out of the body."</p>

<p>"It's easily satisfied, at any rate," he said,
looking at the paste in the soup plate.</p>

<p>"No one actually eats or drinks here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm solid," he said, "am I not?"</p>

<p>"People always think they're solid everywhere,"
she laughed. "It's only a question
of degree; solidity <em>here</em> means a different
thing to solidity <em>there</em>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p><p>"I can get thinner though, can't I?" he
asked, thinking of her remark about escape
being easier the lighter he grew.</p>

<p>She assured him there would be no difficulty
about that, and after replying evasively to a
lot more questions, she gathered up the dishes
and once more disappeared through the trap-door.</p>

<p>Jimbo watched her going down the ladder
into the black gulf below, and wondered
greatly where she went to and what she did
down there; but on these points the governess
had refused to satisfy his curiosity, and every
time she appeared or disappeared the atmosphere
of mystery came and went with her.</p>

<p>As he stared, wondering, a sound suddenly
made itself heard behind him, and on turning
quickly round he saw to his great surprise
that the door into the passage was open.
This was more than he could resist, and in
another minute, with mingled feelings of
dread and delight, he was out in the passage.</p>

<p>When he was first brought to the house,
two hours before, it had been too dark to see
properly, but now the sun was high in the
heavens, and the light still increasing. He
crept cautiously to the head of the stairs and
peered over into the well of the house. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was still too dark to make things out clearly;
but, as he looked, he thought something
moved among the shadows below, and for a
moment his heart stood still with fear. A
large grey face seemed to be staring up at
him out of the gloom. He clutched the
banisters and felt as if he hardly had strength
enough in his legs to get back to the room
he had just left; but almost immediately the
terror passed, for he saw that the face resolved
itself into the mingling of light and shadow,
and the features, after all, were of his own
creation. He went on slowly and stealthily
down the staircase.</p>

<p>It was certainly an empty house. There
were no carpets; the passages were cold and
draughty; the paper curled from the damp
walls, leaving ugly discoloured patches about;
cobwebs hung in many places from the ceiling,
the windows were more or less broken, and all
were coated so thickly with dirt that the rain
had traced little furrows from top to bottom.
Shadows hung about everywhere, and Jimbo
thought every minute he saw moving figures;
but the figures always resolved themselves
into nothing when he looked closely.</p>

<p>He began to wonder how far it was safe to
go, and why the governess had arranged for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the door to be opened&mdash;for he felt sure it was
she who had done this, and that it was all
right for him to come out. Fright, she had
said, was never about in the daylight. But,
at the same time, something warned him to
be ready at a moment's notice to turn and
dash up the stairs again to the room where
he was at least comparatively safe.</p>

<p>So he moved along very quietly and very
cautiously. He passed many rooms with the
doors open&mdash;all empty and silent; some of
them had tables and chairs, but no sign of
occupation; the grates were black and empty,
the walls blank, the windows unshuttered.
Everywhere was only silence and shadows;
there was no sign of the frightened children,
or of where they lived; no trace of another
staircase leading to the region where the
governess went when she disappeared down
the ladder through the trap-door&mdash;only hushed,
listening, cold silence, and shadows that
seemed for ever shifting from place to place
as he moved past them. This illusion of
people peering at him from corners, and
behind doors just ajar, was very strong; yet
whenever he turned his head to face them, lo,
they were gone, and the shadows rushed in
to fill their places.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p><p>The spell of the Empty House was weaving
itself slowly and surely about his heart.</p>

<p>Yet he went on pluckily, full of a dreadful
curiosity, continuing his search, and at length,
after passing through another gloomy passage,
he was in the act of crossing the threshold of
an open door leading out into the courtyard,
when he stopped short and clutched the door-posts
with both hands.</p>

<p>Some one had laughed!</p>

<p>He turned, trying to look in every direction
at once, but there was no sign of any living
being. Yet the sound was close beside him;
he could still hear it ringing in his ears&mdash;a
mocking sort of laugh, in a harsh, guttural
voice. The blood froze in his veins, and he
hardly knew which way to turn, when another
voice sounded, and his terror disappeared as
if by magic.</p>

<p>It was Miss Lake's voice calling to him over
the banisters at the top of the house, and its
tone was so cheerful that all his courage came
back in a twinkling.</p>

<p>"Go out into the yard," she called, "and
play in the sunshine. But don't stay too long."</p>

<p>Jimbo answered "All right" in a rather
feeble little voice, and went on down the
passage and out into the yard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p><p>The June sunshine lay hot and still over the
paved court, and he looked up into the blue
sky overhead. As he looked at the high wall
that closed it in on three sides, he realised
more than ever that he was caught in a
monstrous trap from which there could be no
ordinary means of escape. He could never
climb over such a wall even with a ladder.
He walked out a little way and noticed the
rank weeds growing in patches in the corners;
decay and neglect left everywhere their dismal
signs; the yard, in spite of the sunlight,
seemed as gloomy and cheerless as the house
itself.</p>

<p>In one corner stood several little white
upright stones, each about three feet high;
there seemed to be some writing on them,
and he was in the act of going nearer to
inspect, when a window opened and he heard
some one calling to him in a loud, excited
whisper:</p>

<p>"Hst! Come in, Jimbo, at once. Quick!
Run for your life!"</p>

<p>He glanced up, quaking with fear, and saw
the governess leaning out of the open window.
At another window, a little beyond her, he
thought a number of white little faces pressed
against the glass, but he had no time to look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
more closely, for something in Miss Lake's
voice made him turn and run into the house
and up the stairs as though Fright himself
were close at his heels. He flew up the three
flights, and found the governess coming out
on the top landing to meet him. She caught
him in her arms and dashed back into the
room, as if there was not a moment to be
lost, slamming the door behind her.</p>

<p>"How in the world did you get out?"
she gasped, breathless as himself almost, and
pale with alarm. "Another second and He'd
have had you&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I found the door open&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He opened it on purpose," she whispered,
looking quickly round the room. "He meant
you to go out."</p>

<p>"But you called to me to play in the yard,"
he said. "I heard you. So of course I thought
it was safe."</p>

<p>"No," she declared, "I never called to you.
That wasn't my voice. That was one of his
tricks. I only this minute found the door
open and you gone. Oh, Jimbo, that was a
narrow escape; you must never go out of
this room till&mdash;till I tell you. And never
believe any of these voices you hear&mdash;you'll
hear lots of them, saying all sorts of things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&mdash;but
unless you <em>see</em> me, don't believe it's my
voice."</p>

<p>Jimbo promised. He was very frightened;
but she would not tell him any more, saying
it would only make it more difficult to escape
if he knew too much in advance. He told
her about the laugh, and the gravestones, and
the faces at the other window, but she would
not tell him what he wanted to know, and at
last he gave up asking. A very deep impression
had been made on his mind, however,
and he began to realise, more than he had
hitherto done, the horror of his prison and the
power of his dreadful keeper.</p>

<p>But when he began to look about him
again, he noticed that there was a new thing
in the room. The governess had left him,
and was bending over it. She was doing
something very busily indeed. He asked her
what it was.</p>

<p>"I'm making your bed," she said.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a bed, and he felt as he
looked at it that there was something very
familiar and friendly about the yellow framework
and the little brass knobs.</p>

<p>"I brought it up just now," she explained.
"But it's not for sleeping in. It's only for you
to lie down on, and also partly to deceive Him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p><p>"Why not for sleeping?"</p>

<p>"There's no sleeping at all here," she went
on calmly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You can't sleep out of your body," she
laughed.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked again.</p>

<p>"Your body goes to sleep, but <em>you</em> don't,"
she explained.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see." His head was whirling.
"And my body&mdash;my real body&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is lying asleep&mdash;unconscious they call it&mdash;in
the night-nursery at home. It's sound
asleep. That's why you're here. It can't
wake up till you go back to it, and you can't
go back to it till you escape&mdash;even if it's
ready for you before then. The bed is only
for you to rest on, for you can <em>rest</em> though you
can't <em>sleep</em>."</p>

<p>Jimbo stared blankly at the governess for
some minutes. He was debating something
in his mind, something very important, and
just then it was his Older Self, and not the
child, that was uppermost. Apparently it
was soon decided, for he walked sedately up
to her and said very gravely, with her serious
eyes fixed on his face, "Miss Lake, are you <em>really</em> Miss Lake?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p><p>"Of course I am."</p>

<p>"You're not a trick of His, like the voices,
I mean?"</p>

<p>"No, Jimbo, I am really Miss Lake, the
discharged governess who frightened you."
There was profound anxiety in every word.</p>

<p>Jimbo waited a minute, still looking steadily
into her eyes. Then he put out his hand
cautiously and touched her. He rose a little
on tiptoe to be on a level with her face, taking
a fold of her cloak in each hand. The soul-knowledge
was in his eyes just then, not the
mere curiosity of the child.</p>

<p>"And are you&mdash;<em>dead</em>?" he asked, sinking
his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>For a moment the woman's eyes wavered.
She turned white and tried to move away;
but the boy seized her hand and peered more
closely into her face.</p>

<p>"I mean, if we escape and I get back into
my body," he whispered, "will you get back
into yours too?"</p>

<p>The governess made no reply, and shifted
uneasily on her feet. But the boy would not
let her go.</p>

<p>"Please answer," he urged, still in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Jimbo, what funny questions you ask!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
she said at last, in a husky voice, but trying
to smile.</p>

<p>"But I want to know," he said. "I must
know. I believe you are giving up everything
just to save me&mdash;<em>everything</em>; and I don't want
to be saved unless you come too. Tell me!"</p>

<p>The colour came back to her cheeks a little,
and her eyes grew moist. Again she tried to
slip past him, but he prevented her.</p>

<p>"You must tell me," he urged; "I would
rather stay here with you than escape back
into my body and leave you behind."</p>

<p>Jimbo knew it was his Older Self speaking&mdash;the
freed spirit rather than the broken
body&mdash;but he felt the strain was very great;
he could not keep it up much longer; any
minute he might slip back into the child again,
and lose interest, and be unequal to the task
he now saw so clearly before him.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he cried in a louder voice.
"Tell me! You are giving up everything to
save me, aren't you? And if I escape you
will be left alone&mdash;&mdash;quick, answer me! Oh,
be quick, I'm slipping back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Already he felt his thoughts becoming confused
again, as the spirit merged back into the
child; in another minute the boy would usurp
the older self.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p><p>"You see," began the governess at length,
speaking very gently and sadly, "I am bound
to make amends whatever happens. I must
atone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But already he found it hard to follow.</p>

<p>"Atone," he asked, "what does '<em>atone</em>'
mean?" He moved back a step, and glanced
about the room. The moment of concentration
had passed without bearing fruit; his
thoughts began to wander again like a child's.
"Anyhow, we shall escape together when the
chance comes, shan't we?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, we shall," she said in a broken
voice. "And if you do what I tell you, it
will come very soon, I hope." She drew him
towards her and kissed him, and though he
didn't respond very heartily, he felt he liked
it, and was sure that she was good, and meant
to do the best possible for him.</p>

<p>Jimbo asked nothing more for some time;
he turned to the bed where he found a mattress
and a blanket, but no sheets, and sat
down on the edge and waited. The governess
was standing by the window looking out;
her back was turned to him. He heard an
occasional deep sigh come from her, but he
was too busy now with his own sensations to
trouble much about her. Looking past her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he saw the sea of green leaves dancing lazily
in the sunshine. Something seemed to beckon
him from beyond the high wall, and he longed
to go out and play in the shade of the elms
and hawthorns; for the horror of the Empty
House was closing in upon him steadily but
surely, and he longed for escape into a bright,
unhaunted atmosphere, more than anything
else in the whole world.</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on and on in this vein,
till presently he noticed that the governess
was moving about the room. She crossed
over and tried first one door and then the
other; both were fastened. Next she lifted
the trap-door and peered down into the black
hole below. That, too, apparently was satisfactory.
Then she came over to the bedside
on tiptoe.</p>

<p>"Jimbo, I've got something very important
to ask you," she began.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, full of curiosity.</p>

<p>"You must answer me very exactly.
Everything depends on it."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>She took another long look round the room,
and then, in a still lower whisper, bent over
him, and asked:</p>

<p>"Have you any pain?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p><p>"Where?" he asked, remembering to be
exact.</p>

<p>"Anywhere."</p>

<p>He thought a moment.</p>

<p>"None, thank you."</p>

<p>"None at all&mdash;anywhere?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"None at all&mdash;anywhere," he said with
decision.</p>

<p>She seemed disappointed.</p>

<p>"Never mind; it's a little soon yet, perhaps,"
she said. "We must have patience. It will
come in time."</p>

<p>"But I don't want any pain," he said,
rather ruefully.</p>

<p>"You can't escape till it comes."</p>

<p>"I don't understand a bit what you mean."
He began to feel alarmed at the notion of
escape and pain going together.</p>

<p>"You'll understand later, though," she said
soothingly, "and it won't hurt <em>very</em> much.
The sooner the pain comes, the sooner we can
try to escape. Nowhere can there be escape
without it."</p>

<p>And with that she left him, disappearing
without another word into the hole below the
trap, and leaving him, disconsolate yet
excited, alone in the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="chapsub">THE GALLERY OF ANCIENT MEMORIES</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> every one, of course, the measurement
of time depends largely upon the state of the
emotions, but in Jimbo's case it was curiously
exaggerated. This may have been because
he had no standard of memory by which to
test the succession of minutes; but, whatever
it was, the hours passed very quickly,
and the evening shadows were already darkening
the room when at length he got up
from the mattress and went over to the
window.</p>

<p>Outside the high elms were growing dim;
soon the stars would be out in the sky. The
afternoon had passed away like magic, and
the governess still left him alone; he could
not quite understand why she went away for
such long periods.</p>

<p>The darkness came down very swiftly, and
it was night almost before he knew it. Yet
he felt no drowsiness, no desire to yawn and
get under sheets and blankets; sleep was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
evidently out of the question, and the hours
slipped away so rapidly that it made little
difference whether he sat up all night or
whether he slept.</p>

<p>It was his first night in the Empty House,
and he wondered how many more he would
spend there before escape came. He stood at
the window, peering out into the growing
darkness and thinking long, long thoughts.
Below him yawned the black gulf of the yard,
and the outline of the enclosing wall was only
just visible, but beyond the elms rose far
into the sky, and he could hear the wind
singing softly in their branches. The sound
was very sweet; it suggested freedom, and
the flight of birds, and all that was wild and
unrestrained. The wind could never really
be a prisoner; its voice sang of open spaces
and unbounded distances, of flying clouds and
mountains, of mighty woods and dancing
waves; above all, of wings&mdash;free, swift, and
unconquerable wings.</p>

<p>But this rushing song of wind among the
leaves made him feel too sad to listen long,
and he lay down upon the bed again, still
thinking, thinking.</p>

<p>The house was utterly still. Not a thing
stirred within its walls. He felt lonely, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
began to long for the companionship of the
governess; he would have called aloud for
her to come only he was afraid to break the
appalling silence. He wondered where she
was all this time and how she spent the long,
dark hours of the sleepless nights. Were all
these things really true that she told him?
Was he actually out of his body, and was his
name really Jimbo? His thoughts kept
groping backwards, ever seeking the other
companions he had lost; but, like a piece of
stretched elastic too short to reach its object,
they always came back with a snap just when
he seemed on the point of finding them. He
wanted these companions very badly indeed,
but the struggling of his memory was painful,
and he could not keep the effort up for very
long at one time.</p>

<p>The effort once relaxed, however, his
thoughts wandered freely where they would;
and there rose before his mind's eye dim suggestions
of memories far more distant&mdash;ghostly
scenes and faces that passed before
him in endless succession, but always faded away
before he could properly seize and name them.</p>

<p>This memory, so stubborn as regards quite
recent events, began to play strange tricks
with him. It carried him away into a Past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
so remote that he could not connect it with
himself at all, and it was like dreaming of
scenes and events that had happened to some
one else; yet, all the time, he knew quite
well those things had happened to him, and
to none else. It was the memory of the soul
asserting itself now that the clamour of the
body was low. It was an underground river
coming to the surface, for odd minutes, here
and there, showing its waters to the stars just
long enough to catch their ghostly reflections
before it rolled away underground again.</p>

<p>Yet, swift and transitory as they were, these
glimpses brought in their train sensations that
were too powerful ever to have troubled his
child-mind in its present body. They stirred
in him the strong emotions, the ecstasies, the
terrors, the yearnings of a much more distant
past; whispering to him, could he but have
understood, of an infinitely deeper layer of
memories and experiences which, now released
from the burden of the immediate years,
strove to awaken into life again. The soul
in that little body covered with alpaca knickerbockers
and a sailor blouse seemed suddenly
to have access to a storehouse of knowledge
that must have taken centuries, rather than
a few short years, to acquire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p><p>It was all very queer. The feeling of
tremendous age grew mysteriously over him.
He realised that he had been wandering for
ages. He had been to the stars and also to
the deeps; he had roamed over strange mountains
far away from cities or inhabited places
of the earth, and had lived by streams whose
waves were silvered by moonlight dropping
softly through whispering palm branches....</p>

<p>Some of these ghostly memories brought
him sensations of keenest happiness&mdash;icy,
silver, radiant; others swept through his heart
like a cold wave, leaving behind a feeling of
unutterable woe, and a sense of loneliness that
almost made him cry aloud. And there came
Voices too&mdash;Voices that had slept so long in
the inner kingdoms of silence that they failed
to rouse in him the very slightest emotion of
recognition....</p>

<p>Worn out at length with the surging of
these strange hosts through him, he got up
and went to the open window again. The
night was very dark and warm, but the stars
had disappeared, and there was the hush and
the faint odour of coming rain in the air. He
smelt leaves and the earth and the moist things
of the ground, the wonderful perfume of the
life of the soil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p><p>The wind had dropped; all was silent as
the grave; the leaves of the elm trees were
motionless; no bird or insect raised its voice;
everything slept; he alone was watchful,
awake. Leaning over the window-sill, his
thoughts searched for the governess, and he
wondered anew where she was spending the
dark hours. She, too, he felt sure, was
wakeful somewhere, watching with him,
plotting their escape together, and always
mindful of his safety....</p>

<p>His reverie was suddenly interrupted by the
flight of an immense night-bird dropping
through the air just above his head. He sprang
back into the room with a startled cry, as it
rushed past in the darkness with a great
swishing of wings. The size of the creature
filled him with awe; it was so close that the
wind it made lifted the hair on his forehead,
and he could almost feel the feathers brush
his cheeks. He strained his eyes to try and
follow it, but the shadows were too deep and
he could see nothing; only in the distance,
growing every moment fainter, he could hear
the noise of big wings threshing the air. He
waited a little, wondering if another bird
would follow it, or if it would presently return
to its perch on the roof; and then his thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
passed on to uncertain memories of other big
birds&mdash;hawks, owls, eagles&mdash;that he had seen
somewhere in places now beyond the reach of
distinct recollections....</p>

<p>Soon the light began to dawn in the east,
and he made out the shape of the elm trees
and the dreadful prison wall; and with
the first real touch of morning light he heard
a familiar creaking sound in the room behind
him, and saw the black hood of the governess
rising through the trap-door in the floor.</p>

<p>"But you've left me alone all night!" he
said at once reproachfully, as she kissed him.</p>

<p>"On purpose," she answered. "He'd get
suspicious if I stayed too much with you.
It's different in the daytime, when he can't
see properly."</p>

<p>"Where's he been all night, then?" asked
the boy.</p>

<p>"Last night he was out most of the time&mdash;hunting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hunting!" he repeated, with excitement.
"Hunting what?"</p>

<p>"Children&mdash;frightened children," she replied,
lowering her voice. "That's how he found you."</p>

<p>It was a horrible thought&mdash;Fright hunting
for victims to bring to his dreadful prison&mdash;and
Jimbo shivered as he heard it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p><p>"And how did you get on all this time?"
she asked, hurriedly changing the subject.</p>

<p>"I've been remembering, that is half-remembering,
an awful lot of things, and
feeling, oh, so old. I never want to remember
anything again," he said wearily.</p>

<p>"You'll forget quick enough when you get
back into your body, and have only the
body-memories," she said, with a sigh that he
did not understand. "But, now tell me,"
she added, in a more serious voice, "have you
had any pain yet?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. She stepped up beside
him.</p>

<p>"None <em>there</em>?" she asked, touching him
lightly just behind the shoulder blades.</p>

<p>Jimbo jumped as if he had been shot, and
uttered a piercing yell.</p>

<p>"That hurts!" he screamed.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," cried the governess. "That's
the pains coming at last." Her face was
beaming.</p>

<p>"Coming!" he echoed, "I think they've
<em>come</em>. But if they hurt as much as that, I
think I'd rather not escape," he added ruefully.</p>

<p>"The pain won't last more than a minute,"
she said calmly. "You must be brave and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
stand it. There's no escape without pain&mdash;from
anything."</p>

<p>"If there's no other way," he said pluckily,
"I'll try,&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You see," she went on, rather absently,
"at this very moment the doctor is probing
the wounds in your back where the horns
went in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was not listening. Her explanations
always made him want either to cry or
to laugh. This time he laughed, and the
governess joined him, while they sat on the
edge of the bed together talking of many
things. He did not understand all her explanations,
but it comforted him to hear them.
So long as somebody understood, no matter
who, he felt it was all right.</p>

<p>In this way several days and nights passed
quickly away. The pains were apparently
no nearer, but as Miss Lake showed no particular
anxiety about their non-arrival, he
waited patiently too, dreading the moment,
yet also looking forward to it exceedingly.</p>

<p>During the day the governess spent most
of the time in the room with him; but at night,
when he was alone, the darkness became enchanted,
the room haunted, and he passed into
the long, long Gallery of Ancient Memories.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="chapsub">THE MEANS OF ESCAPE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> passed, and Jimbo began to wonder
if the pains he so much dreaded, yet so eagerly
longed for, were ever coming at all. The
imprisonment was telling upon him, and he
grew very thin, and consequently very light.</p>

<p>The nights, though he spent them alone,
were easily borne, for he was then intensely
occupied, and the time passed swiftly; the
moment it was dark he stepped into the
Gallery of Memories, and in a little while
passed into a new world of wonder and delight.
But the daytime seemed always long. He
stood for hours by the window watching the
trees and the sky, and what he saw always
set painful currents running through his
blood&mdash;unsatisfied longings, yearnings, and
immense desires he never could understand.</p>

<p>The white clouds on their swift journeys
took with them something from his heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
every time he looked upon them; they
melted into air and blue sky, and lo! that
"something" came back to him charged with
all the wild freedom and magic of open spaces,
distance, and rushing winds.</p>

<p>But the change was close at hand.</p>

<p>One night, as he was standing by the open
window listening to the drip of the rain, he
felt a deadly weakness steal over him; the
strength went out of his legs. First he turned
hot, and then he turned cold; clammy perspiration
broke out all over him, and it was
all he could do to crawl across the room and
throw himself on to the bed. But no sooner
was he stretched out on the mattress than the
feelings passed entirely, and left behind them
an intoxicating sense of strength and lightness.
His muscles became like steel springs; his
bones were strong as iron and light as cork;
a wonderful vigour had suddenly come into
him, and he felt as if he had just stepped from
a dungeon into fresh air. He was ready to
face anything in the world.</p>

<p>But, before he had time to realise the full
enjoyment of these new sensations, a stinging,
blinding pain shot suddenly through his right
shoulder as if a red-hot iron had pierced to the
very bone. He screamed out in agony;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
though, even while he screamed, the pain
passed. Then the same thing happened in his
other shoulder. It shot through his back with
equal swiftness, and was gone, leaving him
lying on the bed trembling with pain. But
the instant it was gone the delightful sensations
of strength and lightness returned, and
he felt as if his whole body were charged with
some new and potent force.</p>

<p>The pains had come at last! Jimbo had
no notion how they could possibly be connected
with escape, but Miss Lake&mdash;his kind
and faithful friend, Miss Lake&mdash;had said that
no escape was possible without them; and
had promised that they should be brief. And
this was true, for the entire episode had not
taken a minute of time.</p>

<p>"<em class="uc">ESCAPE, ESCAPE!</em>"&mdash;the words rushed
through him like a flame of fire. Out of this
dreadful Empty House, into the open spaces;
beyond the prison wall; out where the wind
and the rain could touch him; where he could
feel the grass beneath his feet, and could see
the whole sky at once, instead of this narrow
strip through the window. His thoughts flew
to the stars and the clouds....</p>

<p>But a strange humming of voices interrupted
his flight of imagination, and he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that the room was suddenly full of moving
figures. They were passing before him with
silent footsteps, across the window from door
to door. How they had come in, or how
they went out, he never knew; but his heart
stood still for an instant as he recognised the
mournful figures of the Frightened Children
filing before him in a slow procession. They
were singing&mdash;though it sounded more like
a chorus of whispering than actual singing&mdash;and
as they moved past with the measured
steps of their sorrowful dance, he caught the
words of the song he had heard them sing
when he first came into the house:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"We hear the little voices in the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing of freedom we may never find."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jimbo put his fingers into his ears, but still
the sound came through. He heard the words
almost as if they were inside himself&mdash;his own
thoughts singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"We hear the little footsteps in the rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Running to help us, though they run in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tapping in hundreds on the window-pane."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The horrible procession filed past and melted
away near the door. They were gone as
mysteriously as they had come, and almost
before he realised it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p><p>He sprang from the bed and tried the doors;
both were locked. How in the world had the
children got in and out? The whispering
voices rose again on the night air, and this
time he was sure they came from outside.
He ran to the open window and thrust his head
out cautiously. Sure enough, the procession
was moving slowly, still with the steps of that
impish dance across the courtyard stones. He
could just make out the slow waving arms,
the thin bodies, and the white little faces as
they passed on silent feet through the darkness,
and again a fragment of the song rose to
his ears as he watched, and filled him with an
overpowering sadness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"We have no joy in any children's game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For happiness to us is but a name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Terror kissed us with his lips of flame."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he noticed that the group was growing
smaller. Already the numbers were less.
Somewhere, over there in the dark corner of
the yard, the children disappeared, though it
was too dark to see precisely how or where.</p>

<p>"We dance with phantoms, and with
shadows play," rose to his ears.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered the little white
upright stones he had seen in that corner of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the yard, and understood. One by one they
vanished just behind those stones.</p>

<p>Jimbo shivered, and drew his head in. He
did not like those upright stones; they made
him uncomfortable and afraid. Now, however,
the last child had disappeared and the
song had ceased. He realised what his fate
would be if the escape were not successful;
he would become one of this band of Frightened
Children; dwelling somewhere behind the
upright stones; a terrified shadow, waiting
in vain to be rescued, waiting perhaps for
ever and ever. The thought brought the
tears to his eyes, but he somehow managed
to choke them down. He knew it was the
young portion of him only that felt afraid&mdash;the
body; the older self could not feel fear,
and had nothing to do with tears.</p>

<p>He lay down again upon the hard mattress
and waited; and soon afterwards the first
crimson streaks of sunrise appeared behind
the high elms, and rooks began to caw and
shake their wings in the upper branches. A
little later the governess came in.</p>

<p>Before he could move out of the way&mdash;for
he disliked being embraced&mdash;she had her arms
round his neck, and was covering him with
kisses. He saw tears in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p><p>"You darling Jimbo!" she cried, "they've
come at last."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" he asked, surprised
at her knowledge and puzzled by her display
of emotion.</p>

<p>"I heard you scream to begin with. Besides,
I've been watching."</p>

<p>"Watching?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and listening too, every night, every
single night. You've hardly been a minute
out of my sight," she added.</p>

<p>"I think it's awfully good of you," he said
doubtfully, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A flood of questions followed&mdash;about the
upright stones, the shadowy children, where
she spent the night "watching him," and a
hundred other things besides. But he got
little satisfaction out of her. He never did
when it was Jimbo, the child, that asked;
and he remained Jimbo, the child, all that
day. She only told him that all was going
well. The pains had come; he had grown
nice and thin, and light; the children had
come into his room as a hint that he belonged
to their band, and other things had happened
about which she would tell him later. The
crisis was close at hand. That was all he
could get out of her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p><p>"It won't be long now," she said excitedly.
"They'll come to-night, I expect."</p>

<p>"What will come to-night?" he asked,
with querulous wonder.</p>

<p>"Wait and see!" was all the answer he
got. "Wait and see!"</p>

<p>She told him to lie quietly on the bed and
to have patience.</p>

<p>With asking questions, and thinking, and
wondering, the day passed very quickly.
With the lengthening shadows his excitement
began to grow. Presently Miss Lake took
her departure and went off to her unknown
and mysterious abode; he watched her disappear
through the floor with mingled feelings,
wondering what would have happened before
he saw her again. She gave him a long, last
look as she sank away below the boards,
but it was a look that brought him fresh
courage, and her eyes were happy and
smiling.</p>

<p>Tingling already with expectancy he got
into the bed and lay down, his brain alive with
one word&mdash;<em class="uc">ESCAPE</em>.</p>

<p>From where he lay he saw the stars in the
narrow strip of sky; he heard the wind
whispering in the branches; he even smelt
the perfume of the fields and hedges&mdash;grass,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
flowers, dew, and the sweet earth&mdash;the odours
of freedom.</p>

<p>The governess had, for some reason she
refused to explain, taken his blouse away with
her. For a long time he puzzled over this,
seeking reasons and finding none. But, while
in the act of stroking his bare arms, the pains
of the night before suddenly returned to both
shoulders at once. Fire seemed to run down
his back, splitting his bones apart, and then
passed even more quickly than before, leaving
him with the same wonderful sensations of
lightness and strength. He felt inclined to
shout and run and jump, and it was only the
memory of the governess's earnest caution to
"lie quietly" that prevented his new emotions
passing into acts.</p>

<p>With very great effort he lay still all night
long; and it was only when the room at last
began to get light again that he turned on
his side, preparatory to getting up.</p>

<p>But there was something new&mdash;something
different! He rested on his elbow, waiting.
Something had happened to him. Cautiously
he sat on the edge of the bed, and stretched
out one foot and touched the floor. Excitement
ran through him like a wave. There
was a great change, a tremendous change;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for as he stepped out gingerly on to the floor
<em>something followed him from the bed</em>. It clung
to his back; it touched both shoulders at
once; it stroked his ribs, and tickled the
skin of his arms.</p>

<p>Half frightened, he brought the other leg
over, and stood boldly upright on both feet.
But the weight still clung to his back. He
looked over his shoulder. Yes! it was trailing
after him from the bed; it was fan-shaped,
and brilliant in colour. He put out a hand
and touched it; it was soft and glossy; then
he took it deliberately between his fingers;
it was smooth as velvet, and had numerous
tiny ribs running along it.</p>

<p>Seizing it at last with all his courage, he
pulled it forward in front of him for a better
view, only to discover that it would not come
out beyond a certain distance, and seemed
to have got caught somehow between his
shoulders&mdash;just where the pains had been.
A second pull, more vigorous than the first,
showed that it was not caught, but <em>fastened</em> to
his skin; it divided itself, moreover, into two
portions, one half coming from each shoulder.</p>

<p>"I do believe they're feathers!" he exclaimed,
his eyes almost popping out of his
head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p><p>Then, with a sudden flash of comprehension,
he saw it all, and understood. They were,
indeed, feathers; but they were something
more than feathers merely. <em>They were
wings!</em></p>

<p>Jimbo caught his breath and stared in
silence. He felt dazed. Then bit by bit the
fragments of the weird mosaic fell into their
proper places, and he began to understand.
Escape was to be by flight. It filled him
with such a whirlwind of delight and excitement
that he could scarcely keep from screaming
aloud.</p>

<p>Lost in wonder, he took a step forward,
and watched with bulging eyes how the wings
followed him, their tips trailing along the
floor. They were a beautiful deep red, and
hung down close and warm beside his body;
glossy, sleek, magical. And when, later, the
sun burst into the room and turned their
colour into living flame, he could not resist
the temptation to kiss them. He seized them,
and rubbed their soft surfaces over his face.
Such colours he had never seen before, and
he wanted to be sure that they really belonged
to him and were intended for actual use.</p>

<p>Slowly, without using his hands, he raised
them into the air. The effort was a perfectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
easy muscular effort from the shoulders that
came naturally, though he did not quite
understand how he accomplished it. The
wings rose in a fine, graceful sweep, curving
over his head till the tips of the feathers met,
touching the walls as they rose, and almost
reaching to the ceiling.</p>

<p>He gave a howl of delight, for this sight was
more than he could manage without some
outlet for his pent-up emotion; and at the
same moment the trap-door shot open, and
the governess came into the room with such
a bang and a clatter that Jimbo knew at
once her excitement was as great as his own.
In her hands she carried the blouse she had
taken away the night before. She held it
out to him without a word. Her eyes were
shining like electric lamps. In less than a
second he had slipped his wings through the
neatly-made slits, but before he could practise
them again, Miss Lake rushed over to him,
her face radiant with happiness.</p>

<p>"Jimbo! My darling Jimbo!" she cried&mdash;and
then stopped short, apparently unable
to express her emotion.</p>

<p>The next instant he was enveloped, wings
and all, in a warm confusion of kisses, congratulations
and folds of hood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p><p>When they became disentangled again the
governess went down on her knees and made
a careful examination; she pulled the wings
out to their full extent and found that they
stretched about four feet and a half from tip
to tip.</p>

<p>"They <em>are</em> beauties!" she exclaimed enthusiastically,
"and full grown and strong.
I'm not surprised they took so long coming."</p>

<p>"Long!" he echoed, "I thought they came
awfully quickly."</p>

<p>"Not half so quickly as they'll go," she
interrupted; adding, when she saw his expression
of dismay, "I mean, you'll fly like
the wind with them."</p>

<p>Jimbo was simply breathless with excitement.
He wanted to jump out of the window
and escape at once. The blue sky and the
sunshine and the white flying clouds sent him
an irresistible invitation. He could not wait
a minute longer.</p>

<p>"Quick," he cried, "I can't wait! They
may go again. Show me how to use them.
Oh! do show me."</p>

<p>"I'll show you everything in time," she
answered. There was something in her voice
that made him pause in his excitement. He
looked at her in silence for some minutes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>"But how are <em>you</em> going to escape?" he
asked at length. "You haven't got"&mdash;&mdash;he
stopped short.</p>

<p>The governess stepped back a few paces
from him. She threw back the hood from her
face. Then she lifted the long black cloak
that hung like a cassock almost to her ankles
and had always enveloped her hitherto.</p>

<p>Jimbo stared. Falling from her shoulders,
and folding over her hips, he saw long red
feathers clinging to her; and when he dashed
forward to touch them with his hands, he
found they were just as sleek and smooth and
glossy as his own.</p>

<p>"And you never told me all this time?"
he gasped.</p>

<p>"It was safer not," she said. "You'd have
been stroking and feeling your shoulders the
whole time, and the wings might never have
come at all."</p>

<p>She spread out her wings as she spoke to
their full extent; they were nearly six feet
across, and the deep crimson on the under side
was so exquisite, gleaming in the sunlight,
that Jimbo ran in and nestled beneath the
feathers, tickling his cheeks with the fluffy
surface and running his fingers with childish
delight along the slender red quills.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p><p>"You precious child," she said, tenderly
folding her wings round him and kissing the
top of his head. "Always remember that I
really love you; no matter what happens,
remember that, and I'll save you."</p>

<p>"And we shall escape together?" he asked,
submitting for once to the caresses with a
good grace.</p>

<p>"We shall escape from the Empty House
together," she replied evasively. "How far
we can go after that depends&mdash;on you."</p>

<p>"On me?"</p>

<p>"If you love me enough&mdash;as I love you,
Jimbo&mdash;we can never separate again, because
love ties us together for ever. Only," she
added, "it must be mutual."</p>

<p>"I love you very much," he said, puzzled
a little. "Of course I do."</p>

<p>"If you've really forgiven me for being the
cause of your coming here," she said, "we
can always be together, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't remember, but I've forgiven you&mdash;that
<em>other you</em>&mdash;long ago," he said simply.
"If you hadn't brought me here, I should
never have met you."</p>

<p>"That's not real forgiveness&mdash;quite," she
sighed, half to herself.</p>

<p>But Jimbo could not follow this sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
conversation for long; he was too anxious to
try his wings for one thing.</p>

<p>"Is it <em>very</em> difficult to use them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Try," she said.</p>

<p>He stood in the centre of the floor and
raised them again and again. They swept up
easily, meeting over his head, and the air
whistled musically through them. Evidently,
they had their proper muscles, for it was no
great effort, and when he folded them again
by his side they fell into natural curves over
his arms as if they had been there all his life.
The sound of the feathers threshing the air
filled him with delight and made him think of
the big night-bird that had flown past the
window during the night. He told the
governess about it, and she burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"I was that big bird!" she said.</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"I perched on the roof every night to
watch over you. I flew down that time because
I was afraid you were trying to climb
out of the window."</p>

<p>This was indeed a proof of devotion, and
Jimbo felt that he could never doubt her
again; and when she went on to tell him about
his wings and how to use them he listened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
with his very best attention and tried hard to
learn and understand.</p>

<p>"The great difficulty is that you can't
practise properly," she explained. "There's
no room in here, and yet you can't get out till
you <em>fly</em> out. It's the first swoop that decides
all. You have to drop straight out of this
window, and if you use the wings properly
they will carry you in a single swoop over the
wall and right up into the sky."</p>

<p>"But if I miss&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You can't miss," she said with decision,
"but, if you did, you would be a prisoner
here for ever. <em class="uc">HE</em> would catch you in the
yard and tear your wings off. It is just as
well that you should know this at once."</p>

<p>Jimbo shuddered as he heard her.</p>

<p>"When can we try?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Very soon now. The muscles must harden
first, and that takes a little time. You must
practise flapping your wings until you can do
it easily four hundred times a minute. When
you can do that it will be time for the first
start. You must keep your head steady and
not get giddy; the novelty of the motion&mdash;the
ground rushing up into your face and the
whistling of the wind&mdash;are apt to confuse at
first, but it soon passes, and you must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
confidence. I can only help you up to a certain
point; the rest depends on you."</p>

<p>"And the first jump?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to make that by yourself,"
she said; "but you'll do it all right. You're
very light, and won't go too near the ground.
You see, we're like bats, and cannot rise from
the earth. We can only fly by dropping
from a height, and that's what makes the
first plunge rather trying. But you won't
fall," she added, "and remember, I shall
always be within reach."</p>

<p>"You're awfully kind to me," said Jimbo,
feeling his little soul more than ever invaded
by the force of her unselfish care. "I promise
you I'll do my best." He climbed on to her
knee and stared into her anxious face.</p>

<p>"Then you are beginning to love me a
little, aren't you?" she asked softly, putting
her arms round him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said decidedly. "I love you
very much already."</p>

<p>Four hundred times a minute sounded a very
great deal of wing-flapping; but Jimbo
practised eagerly, and though at first he could
only manage about twice a second, or one
hundred and twenty times a minute, he found
this increased very soon to a great deal more,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and before long he was able to do the full
four hundred, though only for a few minutes
at a time.</p>

<p>He stuck to it pluckily, getting stronger
every day. The governess encouraged him as
much as possible, but there was very little
room for her while he was at work, and he
found the best way to practise was at night
when she was out of the way. She told him
that a large bird moved its wings about four
times a second, two up-strokes and two
down-strokes; but a small bird like a partridge
moved its wings so rapidly it was impossible
for the eye to distinguish or count
the strokes. A middle course of four hundred
suited his own case best, and he bent all his
energies to acquire it.</p>

<p>He also learned that the convex outside
curve of wings allowed the wind to escape
over them, while the under side, being concave,
held every breath. Thus the upward
stroke did not simply counterbalance the
downward and keep him stationary. Moreover,
she showed him how the feathers underlapped
each other so that the downward
stroke pressed them closely together to hold
the wind, whereas in the upward stroke they
opened and separated, letting the air slip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
easily through them, thus offering less resistance
to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>By the end of a week Jimbo had practised
so hard that he could keep himself off the
floor in mid-air for half an hour at a time, and
even then without feeling any great fatigue.
His excitement became intense; and, meanwhile,
in his body on the nursery bed, though
he did not know it, the fever was reaching its
crisis. He could think of nothing else but the
joys of flying, and what the first, awful plunge
would be like, and when Miss Lake came up
to him one afternoon and whispered something
in his ear, he was so wildly happy that he
hugged her for several minutes without the
slightest coaxing.</p>

<p>"It's bright and clear," she explained,
"and Fright will not come after us, for he
fears the light, and can only fly on dark and
gloomy nights."</p>

<p>"So we can start&mdash;&mdash;?" he stammered
joyfully.</p>

<p>"To-night," she answered, "for our first
practice-flight."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="chapsub">THE PLUNGE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> enter the world of wings is to enter a new
state of existence. The apparent loss of
weight; the ability to attain full speed in a
few seconds, and to stop suddenly in a headlong
rush without fear of collapse; the power
to steer instantly in any direction by merely
changing the angle of the body; the altered
and enormous view of the green world below&mdash;looking
down upon forests, seas and clouds;
the easy voluptuous rhythm of rising and
falling in long, swinging undulations; and a
hundred other things that simply defy description
and can be appreciated only by
actual experience, these are some of the
delights of the new world of wings and flying.
And the fearful joy of very high speed,
especially when the exhilaration of escape is
added to it, means a condition little short of
real ecstasy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p><p>Yet Jimbo's first flight, the governess had
been careful to tell him, could not be the flight
of final escape; for, even if the wings proved
equal to a prolonged effort, escape was impossible
until there was somewhere safe to
escape to. So it was understood that the
practice flights might be long, or might be
short; the important thing, meanwhile, was
to learn to fly as well as possible. For skilled
flying is very different to mere headlong
rushing, and both courage and perseverance
are necessary to acquire it.</p>

<p>With rare common sense Miss Lake had
said very little about the possibility of failure.
Having warned him about the importance of
not falling, she had then stopped, and the
power of suggestion had been allowed to
work only in the right direction of certain
success. While the boy knew that the first
plunge from the window would be a moment
fraught with the highest danger, his mind
only recognised the mere off-chance of falling
and being caught. He felt confidence in
himself, and by so much, therefore, were the
chances of disaster lessened.</p>

<p>For the rest of the afternoon Jimbo saw
nothing of his faithful companion; he spent
the time practising and resting, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
weary of everything else, he went to the window
and indulged in thrilling calculations
about the exact height from the ground. A
drop of three storeys into a paved courtyard
with a monster waiting to catch him, and a
high wall too close to allow a proper swing,
was an alarming matter from any point of
view. Fortunately, his mind dwelt more on
the delight of prospective flight and freedom
than on the chances of being caught.</p>

<p>The yard lay hot and naked in the afternoon
glare and the enclosing wall had never
looked more formidable; but from his lofty
perch Jimbo could see beyond into soft hayfields
and smiling meadows, yellow with
cowslips and buttercups. Everything that
flew he watched with absorbing interest:
swift blackbirds, whistling as they went, and
crows, their wings purple in the sunshine.
The song of the larks, invisible in the sea of
blue air sent a thrill of happiness through
him&mdash;he, too, might soon know something of
that glad music&mdash;and even the stately flight
of the butterflies, which occasionally ventured
over into the yard, stirred anticipations in
him of joys to come.</p>

<p>The day waned slowly. The butterflies
vanished; the rooks sailed homewards through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the sunset; the wind dropped away, and the
shadows of the high elms lengthened gradually
and fell across the window.</p>

<p>The mysterious hour of the dusk, when the
standard of reality changes and other worlds
come close and listen, began to work its subtle
spell upon his soul. Imperceptibly the
shadows deepened as the veil of night drew
silently across the sky. A gentle breathing
filled the air; trees and fields were composing
themselves to sleep; stars were peeping;
wings were being folded.</p>

<p>But the boy's wings, trembling with life to
the very tips of their long feathers, these were
not being folded. Charged with excitement,
like himself, they were gathering all their forces
for the supreme effort of their first journey out
into the open spaces where they might touch
the secret sources of their own magical life.</p>

<p>For a long, long time he waited; but at
last the trap-door lifted and Miss Lake appeared
above the floor. The moment she
stood in the room he noticed that her wings
came through two little slits in her gown and
folded down close to the body. They almost
touched the ground.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, holding up a
warning finger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p><p>She came over on tiptoe and they began to
talk in low whispers.</p>

<p>"He's on the watch; we must speak very
quietly. We couldn't have a better night for
it. The wind's in the south and the moon
won't be up till we're well on our way."</p>

<p>Now that the actual moment was so near
the boy felt something of fear steal over him.
The night seemed so vast and terrible all of a
sudden&mdash;like an immense black ocean with no
friendly islands where they could fold their
wings and rest.</p>

<p>"Don't waste your strength thinking,"
whispered the governess. "When the time
comes, act quickly, that's all!"</p>

<p>She went over to the window and peered
out cautiously, after a while beckoning the
child to join her.</p>

<p>"He is there," she murmured in his ear.
Jimbo could only make out an indistinct
shadowy object crouching under the wall,
and he was not even positive of that.</p>

<p>"Does he know we're going?" he asked in
an awed whisper.</p>

<p>"He's there on the chance," she muttered,
drawing back into the room. "When there's
a possibility of any one getting frightened he's
bound to be lurking about somewhere near.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
That's Fright all over. But he can't hurt
you," she added, "because you're not
going to get frightened. Besides, he can only
fly when it's dark; and to-night we shall have
the moon."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," declared the boy in spite
of a rather fluttering heart.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" was all she said.</p>

<p>At last, then, the moment had come. It
was actually beside him, waiting, full of
mystery and wonder, with alarm not far
behind. The sun was buried below the
horizon of the world, and the dusk had
deepened into night. Stars were shining
overhead; the leaves were motionless; not
a breath stirred; the earth was silent and
waiting.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm ready," he whispered, almost
inaudibly.</p>

<p>"Then listen," she said, "and I'll tell you
exactly what to do: Jump upwards from the
window ledge as high as you can, and the
moment you begin to drop, open your wings
and strike with all your might. You'll rise
at once. The thing to remember is to <em>rise as
quickly as possible</em>, because the wall prevents
a long, easy, sweeping rise; and, whatever
happens, you must clear that wall!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p><p>"I shan't touch the ground then?" asked
a faint little voice.</p>

<p>"Of course not! You'll get near it, but
the moment you use your wings you'll stop
sinking, and rise up, up, up, ever so quickly."</p>

<p>"And where to?"</p>

<p>"To me. You'll see me waiting for you
above the trees. Steering will come naturally;
it's quite easy."</p>

<p>Jimbo was already shaking with excitement.
He could not help it. And he knew, in spite
of all Miss Lake's care, that Fright was waiting
in the yard to catch him if he fell, or sank
too near the ground.</p>

<p>"I'll go first," added the governess, "and
the moment you see that I've cleared the wall
you must jump after me. Only do not keep
me waiting!"</p>

<p>The girl stood for a minute in silence,
arranging her wings. Her fingers were trembling
a little. Suddenly she drew the boy to
her and kissed him passionately.</p>

<p>"Be brave!" she whispered, looking
searchingly into his eyes, "and strike hard&mdash;you
can't possibly fail."</p>

<p>In another minute she was climbing out of
the window. For one second he saw her
standing on the narrow ledge with black space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
at her feet; the next, without even a cry, she
sprang out into the darkness, and was gone.</p>

<p>Jimbo caught his breath and ran up to see.
She dropped like a stone, turning over sideways
in the air, and then at once her wings
opened on both sides and she righted. The
darkness swallowed her up for a moment so
that he could not see clearly, and only heard
the threshing of the huge feathers; but it
was easy to tell from the sound that she was
rising.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a black form cleared the
wall and rose swiftly in a magnificent sweep
into the sky, and he saw her outlined darkly
against the stars above the high elm tree.
She was safe. Now it was his turn.</p>

<p>"Act quickly! Don't think!" rang in his
ears. If only he could do it all as quickly as
she had done it. But insidious fear had been
working all the time below the surface, and
his refusal to recognise it could not prevent it
weakening his muscles and checking his power
of decision. Fortunately something of his
Older Self came to the rescue. The emotions
of fear, excitement, and intense anticipation
combined to call up the powers of his deeper
being: the boy trembled horribly, but the
old, experienced part of him sang with joy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p><p>Cautiously he began to climb out on to the
window-sill; first one foot and then the other
hung over the edge. He sat there, staring
down into black space beneath.</p>

<p>For a minute he hesitated; despair rushed
over him in a wave; he could never take that
awful jump into emptiness and darkness. It
was impossible. Better be a prisoner for ever
than risk so fearful a plunge. He felt cold,
weak, frightened, and made a half-movement
back into the room. The wings caught somehow
between his legs and nearly flung him
headlong into the yard.</p>

<p>"Jimbo! I'm waiting for you!" came at
that moment in a faint cry from the stars,
and the sound gave him just the impetus he
needed before it was too late. He could not
disappoint her&mdash;his faithful friend. Such a
thing was impossible.</p>

<p>He stood upright on the ledge, his hands
clutching the window-sash behind, balancing
as best he could. He clenched his fists, drew
a deep, long breath, and jumped upwards and
forwards into the air.</p>

<p>Up rushed the darkness with a shriek; the
air whistled in his ears; he dropped at fearful
speed into nothingness.</p>

<p>At first everything was forgotten&mdash;wings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
instructions, warnings, and all. He even
forgot to open his wings at all, and in another
second he would have been dashed upon the
hard paving-stones of the courtyard where his
great enemy lay waiting to seize him.</p>

<p>But just in the nick of time he remembered,
and the long hours of practice bore fruit.
Out flew the great red wings in a tremendous
sweep on both sides of him, and he began to
strike with every atom of strength he possessed.
He had dropped to within six feet of the
ground; but at once the strokes began to
tell, and oh, magical sensation! he felt himself
rising easily, lightly, swiftly.</p>

<p>A very slight effort of those big wings would
have been sufficient to lift him out of danger,
but in his terror and excitement he quite miscalculated
their power, and in a single moment
he was far out of reach of the dangerous yard
and anything it contained. But the mad
rush of it all made his head swim; he felt
dizzy and confused, and, instead of clearing
the wall, he landed on the top of it and clung
to the crumbling coping with hands and feet,
panting and breathless.</p>

<p>The dizziness was only momentary, however.
In less than a minute he was on his
feet and in the act of taking his second leap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
into space. This time it came more easily.
He dropped, and the field swung up to meet
him. Soon the powerful strokes of his wings
drove him at great speed upwards, and he
bounded ever higher towards the stars.</p>

<p>Overhead, the governess hovered like an
immense bird, and as he rose up he caught
the sound of her wings beating the air, while
far beneath him, he heard with a shudder a
voice like the rushing of a great river. It
made him increase his pace, and in another
minute he found himself among the little
whirlwinds that raced about from the beating
of Miss Lake's great wings.</p>

<p>"Well done!" cried the delighted governess.
"Safe at last! Now we can fly to our heart's
content!"</p>

<p>Jimbo flew up alongside, and together they
dashed forward into the night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="chapsub">THE FIRST FLIGHT</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was not much talking at first. The
stress of conflicting emotions was so fierce
that the words choked themselves in his throat,
and the desire for utterance found its only
vent in hard breathing.</p>

<p>The intoxication of rapid motion carried
him away headlong in more senses than one.
At first he felt as if he never would be able
to keep up; then it seemed as if he never
would get down again. For with wings it is
almost easier to rise than to fall, and a first
flight is, before anything else, a series of vivid
and audacious surprises.</p>

<p>For a long time Jimbo was so dizzy with
excitement and the novelty of the sensation
that he forgot his deliverer altogether.</p>

<p>And what a flight it was! Instead of the
steady race of the carrier pigeon, or of the
rooks homeward bound at evening, it was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
see-saw motion of the wren's swinging journey
across the lawn; only heavier, faster, and with
more terrific impetus. Up and down, each
time with a rise and fall of twenty feet, he
careered, whistling through the summer night;
at the drop of each curve, so low that the
scents of dewy grass rose into his face; at
the crest of it, so high that the trees and
hedges often became mere blots upon the dark
surface of the earth.</p>

<p>The fields rushed by beneath him; the
white roads flashed past like streaks of snow.
Sometimes he shot across sheets of water and
felt the cooler air strike his cheeks; sometimes
over sheltered meadows, where the
sunshine had slept all day and the air was
still soft and warm; on and on, as easily as
rain dropping from the sky, or wind rushing
earthwards from between the clouds. Everything
flew past him at an astonishing rate&mdash;everything
but the bright stars that gazed
calmly down overhead; and when he looked
up and saw their steadfastness it helped to
keep within bounds the fine alarm of this first
excursion into the great vault of the sky.</p>

<p>"Gently, child!" gasped Miss Lake behind
him. "We shall never keep it up at this
rate."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p><p>"Oh! but it's so wonderful," he cried,
drawing in the air loudly between his teeth,
and shaking his wings rapidly like a hawk
before it drops.</p>

<p>The pace slackened a little and the girl
drew up alongside. For some time they flew
forward together in silence.</p>

<p>They had been skirting the edge of a wood,
when suddenly the trees fell away and Jimbo
gave a scream and rose fifty feet into the air
with a single bound. Straight in front of him
loomed an immense, glaring disc that seemed
to swim suddenly up into the sky above the
trees. It hung there before his eyes and
dazzled him.</p>

<p>"It's only the moon," cried Miss Lake
from below.</p>

<p>Jimbo dropped through the air to her side
again with a gasp.</p>

<p>"I thought it was a big hole in the sky
with fire rushing through," he explained
breathlessly.</p>

<p>The boy stared, full of wonder and delight,
at the huge flaming circle that seemed to fill
half the heavens in front of him.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried the governess, seizing
his hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p><p>Whish! whew! whirr! A large bird
whipped past them like some winged imp of
darkness, vanishing among the trees far below.
There would certainly have been a collision
but for the girl's energetic interference.</p>

<p>"You must be on the look-out for these
night-birds," she said. "They fly so unexpectedly,
and, of course, they don't see us
properly. Telegraph wires and church steeples
are bad too, but then we shan't fly over cities
much. Keep a good height, it's safer."</p>

<p>They altered their course a little, flying at
a different angle, so that the moon no longer
dazzled them. Steering came quite easily by
turning the body, and Jimbo still led the way,
the governess following heavily and with a
mighty business of wings and flapping.</p>

<p>It was something to remember, the glory
of that first journey through the air. Sixty
miles an hour, and scarcely an effort!
Skimming the long ridges of the hills and rushing
through the pure air of mountain tops;
threading the star-beams; bathing themselves
from head to foot in an ocean of cool,
clean wind; swimming on the waves of
viewless currents&mdash;currents warmed only by
the magic of the stars, and kissed by the
burning lips of flying meteors.</p>

<p>Far below them the moonlight touched the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fields with silver and the murmur of the world
rose faintly to their ears, trembling, as it were,
with the inarticulate dreams of millions.
Everywhere about them thrilled and sang the
unspeakable power of the night. The mystery
of its great heart seemed laid bare before
them.</p>

<p>It was like a wonder-journey in some
Eastern fairy tale. Sometimes they passed
through zones of sweeter air, perfumed with
the scents of hay and wild flowers; at others,
the fresh, damp odour of ploughed fields rose
up to them; or, again, they went spinning
over leagues of forest where the tree-tops
stretched beneath them like the surface of a
wide, green sea, sleeping in the moonlight.
And, when they crossed open water, the stars
shone reflected in their faces; and all the
while the wings, whirring and purring softly
through the darkness, made pleasant music in
their ears.</p>

<p>"I'm tired," declared Jimbo presently.</p>

<p>"Then we'll go down and rest," said his
breathless companion with obvious relief.</p>

<p>She showed him how to spread his wings,
sloping them towards the ground at an angle
that enabled him to shoot rapidly downwards,
at the same time regulating his speed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
least upward tilt. It was a glorious motion,
without effort or difficulty, though the pace
made it hard to keep the eyes open, and
breathing became almost impossible. They
dropped to within ten feet of the ground and
then shot forward again.</p>

<p>But, while the boy was watching his companion's
movements, and paying too little
attention to his own, there rose suddenly
before him out of the ground a huge, bulky
form of something&mdash;and crash&mdash;he flew headlong
into it.</p>

<p>Fortunately it was only a haystack; but
the speed at which he was going lodged his
head several inches under the thatch, whence
he projected horizontally into space, feet,
arms, and wings gyrating furiously. The
governess, however, soon released him with
much laughter, and they dropped down into
the fallen hay upon the ground with no worse
result than a shaking.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lark!" he cried, shaking the
hay out of his feathers, and rubbing his head
rather ruefully.</p>

<p>"Except that larks are hardly night-birds,"
she laughed, helping him.</p>

<p>They settled with folded wings in the
shadow of the haystack; and the big moon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
peeping over the edge at them, must have
surely wondered to see such a funny couple,
in such a place, and at such an hour.</p>

<p>"Mushrooms!" suddenly cried the governess,
springing to her feet. "There must be
lots in this field. I'll go and pick some while
you rest a bit."</p>

<p>Off she went, trapesing over the field in the
moonlight, her wings folded behind her, her
body bent a little forward as she searched,
and in ten minutes she came back with her
hands full. That was undoubtedly the time
to enjoy mushrooms at their best, with the
dew still on their tight little jackets, and the
sweet odour of the earth caught under their
umbrellas.</p>

<p>Soon they were all eaten, and Jimbo was
lying back on a pile of hay, his shoulders
against the wall of the stack, and his wings
gathered round him like a warm cloak of
feathers. He felt cosy and dozy, full of
mushrooms inside and covered with hay and
feathers outside. The governess had once
told him that a sort of open-air sleep sometimes
came after a long flight. It was, of
course, not a real sleep, but a state in which
everything about oneself is forgotten; no
dreams, no movement, no falling asleep and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
waking up in the ordinary sense, but a condition
of deep repose in which recuperation
is very great.</p>

<p>Jimbo would have been greatly interested,
no doubt, to know that his real body on the
bed had also just been receiving nourishment,
and was now passing into a quieter and less
feverish condition. The parallel always held
true between himself and his body in the
nursery, but he could not know anything about
this, and only supposed that it was this
open-air sleep that he felt gently stealing over
him.</p>

<p>It brought at first strange thoughts that
carried him far away to other woods and other
fields. While Miss Lake sat beside him eating
her mushrooms, his mind was drawn off to
some other little folk. But it was always
stopped just short of them. He never could
quite see their faces. Yet his thoughts continued
their search, groping in the darkness;
he felt sure he ought to be sharing his adventures
with these other little persons, whoever
they were; they ought to have been sitting
beside him at that very moment, eating mushrooms,
combing their wings, comparing the
length of their feathers, and snuggling with
him into the warm hay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p><p>But they obstinately hovered just outside
his memory, and refused to come in and
surrender themselves. He could not remember
who they were, and his yearnings went unsatisfied
up to the stars, as yearnings generally
do, while his thoughts returned weary from
their search and he yielded to the seductions
of the soothing open-air sleep.</p>

<p>The moon, meanwhile, rose higher and
higher, drawing a silver veil over the stars.
Upon the field the dews of midnight fell
silently. A faint mist rose from the ground
and covered the flowers in their dim seclusion
under the hedgerows. The hours slipped away
swiftly.</p>

<p>"Come on, Jimbo, boy!" cried the governess
at length. "The moon's below the hills,
and we must be off!"</p>

<p>The boy turned and stared sleepily at her
from his nest in the hay.</p>

<p>"We've got miles to go. Remember the
speed we came at!" she explained, getting up
and arranging her wings.</p>

<p>Jimbo got up slowly and shook himself.</p>

<p>"I've been miles away," he said dreamily,
"miles and miles. But I'm ready to start at
once."</p>

<p>They looked about for a raised place to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
jump from. A ladder stood against the other
side of the haystack. The governess climbed
up it and Jimbo followed her drowsily. Hand
in hand they sprang into the air from the edge
of the thatched roof, and their wings spread
out like sails to catch the wind. It smote
their faces pleasantly as they plunged downwards
and forwards, and the exhilarating rush
of cool air banished from the boy's head the
last vestige of the open-air sleep.</p>

<p>"We must keep up a good pace," cried the
governess, taking a stream and the hedge
beyond in a single sweep. "There's a light
in the east already."</p>

<p>As she spoke a dog howled in a farmyard
beneath them, and she shot upwards as though
lifted by a sudden gust of wind.</p>

<p>"We're too low," she shouted from above.
"That dog felt us near. Come up higher.
It's easier flying, and we've got a long way
to go."</p>

<p>Jimbo followed her up till they were several
hundred feet above the earth and the keen
air stung their cheeks. Then she led him
still higher, till the meadows looked like the
squares on a chess-board and the trees were
like little toy shrubs. Here they rushed
along at a tremendous speed, too fast to speak,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
their wings churning the air into little whirlwinds
and eddies as they passed, whizzing,
whistling, tearing through space.</p>

<p>The fields, however, were still dim in the
shadows that precede the dawn, and the stars
only just beginning to fade, when they saw
the dark outline of the Empty House below
them, and began carefully to descend. Soon
they topped the high elms, startling the rooks
into noisy cawing, and then, skimming the
wall, sailed stealthily on outspread wings
across the yard.</p>

<p>Cautiously dropping down to the level of
the window, they crawled over the sill into
the dark little room, and folded their wings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="chapsub">THE FOUR WINDS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> governess left the boy to his own reflections
almost immediately. He spent the hours
thinking and resting; going over again in his
mind every incident of the great flight and
wondering when the real, final escape would
come, and what it would be like. Thus,
between the two states of excitement he
forgot for a while that he was still a prisoner,
and the spell of horror was lifted temporarily
from his heart.</p>

<p>The day passed quickly, and when Miss
Lake appeared in the evening, she announced
that there could be no flying again that night,
and that she wished instead to give him
important instruction for the future. There
were rules, and signs, and times which he must
learn carefully. The time might come when
he would have to fly alone, and he must be
prepared for everything.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p><p>"And the first thing I have to tell you,"
she said, exactly as though it was a schoolroom,
"is: <em>Never fly over the sea.</em> Our kind
of wings quickly absorb the finer particles of
water and get clogged and heavy over the sea.
You finally cannot resist the drawing power
of the water, and you will be dragged down
and drowned. So be very careful! When
you are flying high it is often difficult to
know where the land ends and the sea begins,
especially on moonless nights. But you can
always be certain of one thing: if there are
no sounds below you&mdash;hoofs, voices, wheels,
wind in trees&mdash;you are over the sea."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the child, listening with great
attention. "And what else?"</p>

<p>"The next thing is: <em>Don't fly too high.</em>
Though we fly like birds, remember we are
not birds, and we can fly where they can't.
We can fly in the ether&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where's that?" he interrupted, half afraid
of the sound.</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed him, laughing at
his fear.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be frightened about,"
she explained. "The air gets lighter and
lighter as you go higher, till at last it stops
altogether. Then there's only ether left.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Birds can't fly in ether because it's too thin.
We can, because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that why it was good for me to get
lighter and thinner?" he interrupted again
in a puzzled voice.</p>

<p>"Partly, yes."</p>

<p>"And what happens in the ether, please?"
It still frightened him a little.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;except that if you fly too high
you reach a point where the earth ceases to
hold you, and you dash off into space. Weight
leaves you then, and the wings move without
effort. Faster and faster you rush upwards,
till you lose all control of your movements,
and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Lake hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;&mdash;?" asked the fascinated
child.</p>

<p>"You may never come down again," she
said slowly. "You may be sucked into
anything that happens to come your way&mdash;a
comet, or a shooting star, or the moon."</p>

<p>"I should like a shooting star best,"
observed the boy, deeply interested. "The
moon frightens me, I think. It looks so dreadfully
clean."</p>

<p>"You won't like any of them when the
time comes," she laughed. "No one ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
gets out again who once gets in. But you'll
never be caught that way after what I've
told you," she added, with decision.</p>

<p>"I shall never want to fly as high as that,
I'm sure," said Jimbo. "And now, please,
what comes next?"</p>

<p>The next thing, she went on to explain, was
the <em>weather</em>, which, to all flying creatures, was
of the utmost importance. Before starting
for a flight he must always carefully consider
the state of the sky, and the direction in which
he wished to go. For this purpose he must
master the meaning and character of the Four
Winds and be able to recognise them in a
moment.</p>

<p>"Once you know these," she said, "you
cannot possibly go wrong. To make it easier,
I've put each Wind into a little simple rhyme,
for you."</p>

<p>"I'm listening," he said eagerly.</p>

<p>"The North Wind is one of the worst and
most dangerous, because it blows so much
faster than you think. It's taken you ten
miles before you think you've gone two. In
starting with a North Wind, always fly <em>against</em>
it; then it will bring you home easily. If
you fly <em>with</em> it, you may be swept so far that
the day will catch you before you can get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
home; and then you're as good as lost. Even
birds fly warily when this wind is about. It
has no lulls or resting-places in it; it blows
steadily on and on, and conquers everything
it comes against&mdash;everything except the
mountains."</p>

<p>"And its rhyme?" asked Jimbo, all ears.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"It will show you the joy of the birds, my child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall know their terrible bliss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will teach you to hide, when the night is wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the storm's too passionate kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    For the Wind of the North<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    Is a volleying forth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    That will lift you with springs<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    In the heart of your wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    And may sweep you away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    To the edge of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, beware of the Wind of the North, my child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly not with the Wind of the North!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"I think I like him all the same," said
Jimbo. "But I'll remember always to fly
against him."</p>

<p>"The East Wind is worse still, for it hurts,"
continued the governess. "It stings and cuts.
It's like the breath of an ice-creature; it
brings hail and sleet and cold rain that beat
down wings and blind the eyes. Like the
North Wind, too, it is dreadfully swift and
full of little whirlwinds, and may easily carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
you into the light of day that would prove
your destruction. Avoid it always; no
hiding-place is safe from it. This is the
rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"It will teach you the secrets the eagles know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the tempests' and whirlwinds' birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the magical weaving of rain and snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they fall from the sky to the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    But an Easterly wind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    Is for ever unkind;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    It will torture and twist you<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    And never assist you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">    But will drive you with might<br /></span>

<p>"The West Wind is really a very nice and
jolly wind in itself," she went on, "but it's
dangerous for a special reason: <em>it will carry
you out to sea</em>. The Empty House is only a
few miles from the coast, and a strong West
Wind would take you there almost before you
had time to get down to earth again. And
there's no use struggling against a really steady
West Wind, for it's simply tireless. Luckily,
it rarely blows at night, but goes down with
the sun. Often, too, it blows hard to the
coast, and then drops suddenly, leaving you
among the fogs and mists of the sea."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p><p>"Rather a nice, exciting sort of wind
though," remarked Jimbo, waiting for the
rhyme.</p>

<p>"A jolly wind," observed Jimbo again.
"But that doesn't leave much over to fly with,"
he added sadly. "They all seem dangerous
or cruel."</p>

<p>"Yes," she laughed, "and so they are till
you can master them&mdash;then they're kind,
only one that's really always safe and kind is
the Wind of the South. It's a sweet, gentle
wind, beloved of all that flies, and you can't
possibly mistake it. You can tell it at once
by the murmuring way it stirs the grasses and
the tops of the trees. Its taste is soft and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
sweet in the mouth like wine, and there's
always a faint perfume about it like gardens
in summer. It is the joy of this wind that
makes all flying things sing. With a South
Wind you can go anywhere and no harm can
come to you."</p>

<p>"Dear old South Wind," cried Jimbo,
rubbing his hands with delight. "I hope it
will blow soon."</p>

<p>"Its rhyme is very easy, too, though you
will always be able to tell it without that,"
she added.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, I love the South Wind already," he
shouted, clapping his hands again. "I hope
it will blow very, <em>very</em> soon."</p>

<p>"It may be rising even now," answered
the governess, leading him to the window.
But, as they gazed at the summer landscape
lying in the fading light of the sunset, all was
still and resting. The air was hushed, the
leaves motionless. There was no call just
then to flight from among the tree-tops, and
he went back into the room disappointed.</p>

<p>"But why can't we escape at once?" he
asked again, after he had given his promise to
remember all she had told him, and to be
extra careful if he ever went out flying alone.</p>

<p>"Jimbo, dear, I've told you before, it's
because your body isn't ready for you yet,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
she answered patiently. "There's hardly any
circulation in it, and if you forced your way
back now the shock might stop your heart
beating altogether. Then you'd be really
dead, and escape would be impossible."</p>

<p>The boy sat on the edge of the bed staring
intently at her while she spoke. Something
clutched at his heart. He felt his Older Self,
with its greater knowledge, rising up out of
the depths within him. The child struggled
with the old soul for possession.</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> got any circulation?" he asked
abruptly at length. "I mean, has <em>your</em> heart
stopped beating?"</p>

<p>But the smile called up by his words froze
on her lips. She crossed to the window and
stood with her back to the fading light,
avoiding his eyes.</p>

<p>"My case, Jimbo, is a little different from
yours," she said presently. "The important
thing is to make certain about your escape.
Never mind about me."</p>

<p>"But escape without you is nothing," he
said, the Older Self now wholly in possession.
"I simply wouldn't go. I'd rather stay
here&mdash;with you."</p>

<p>The governess made no reply, but she turned
her back to the room and leaned out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
window. Jimbo fancied he heard a sob. He
felt a great big heart swelling up within his
little body, and he crossed over beside her.
For some minutes they stood there in silence,
watching the stars that were already shining
faintly in the sky.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens," he said, nestling
against her, "I shan't go from here without
you. Remember that!"</p>

<p>He was going to say a lot more, but somehow
or other, when she stooped over to kiss
his head&mdash;he hardly came up to her shoulder&mdash;it
all ran suddenly out of his mind, and the
little child dropped back into possession again.
The tide of his thoughts that seemed about
to rise, fast and furious, sank away completely,
leaving his mind a clean-washed slate without
a single image; and presently, without any
more words, the governess left him and went
through the trap-door into the silence and
mystery of the house below.</p>

<p>Several hours later, about the middle of the
night, there came over him a most disagreeable
sensation of nausea and dizziness. The
ground rose and fell beneath his feet, the walls
swam about sideways, and the ceiling slid
off into the air. It only lasted a few minutes,
however, and Jimbo knew from what she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
told him that it was the Flying Sickness which
always followed the first long flight.</p>

<p>But, about the same time, another little
body, lying in a night-nursery bed, was being
convulsed with a similar attack; and the
sickness of the little prisoner in the Empty
House had its parallel, strangely enough, in
the half-tenanted body miles away in a
different world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="chapsub">PLEASURES OF FLIGHT</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the night when Jimbo had nearly fallen
into the yard and risked capture, Fright, the
horrible owner of the house, had kept himself
well out of the way, and had allowed himself
to be neither seen nor heard.</p>

<p>But the boy was not foolish enough to fall
into the other trap, and imagine, therefore,
that He did not know what was going on.
Jimbo felt quite sure that He was only waiting
his chance; and the governess's avoidance
of the subject tended to confirm this supposition.</p>

<p>"He's disappeared somewhere and taken
the children with him," she declared when he
questioned her. "And now you know almost
as much as I do."</p>

<p>"But not quite!" he laughed mischievously.</p>

<p>"Enough, though," she replied. "We want
all our energy for escape when it comes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Don't bother about anything else for the
moment."</p>

<p>During the day, when he was alone, his
thoughts and fancies often terrified him; but
at night, when he was rushing through the
heavens, the intense delight of flying drove
all minor emotions out of his consciousness,
and he even forgot his one great desire&mdash;to
escape. One night, however, something happened
that brought it back more keenly than
ever.</p>

<p>He had been out flying alone, but had not
gone far when he noticed that an easterly
wind had begun to rise and was blowing
steadily behind him. With the recent instructions
fresh in his head, he thought it
wiser to turn homewards rather than fight his
way back later against a really strong wind
from this quarter. Flying low along the
surface of the fields so as to avoid its full
force, he suddenly rose up with a good sweep
and settled on the top of the wall enclosing
the yard.</p>

<p>The moonlight lay bright over everything.
His approach had been very quiet. He was
just about to sail across to the window when
something caught his eye, and he hesitated a
moment, and stared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p><p>Something was moving at the other end of
the courtyard.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the moonlight
suddenly grew pale and ghastly; the night
air turned chilly; shivers began to run up
and down his back.</p>

<p>He folded his wings and watched.</p>

<p>At the end of the yard he saw several figures
moving busily to and fro in the shadow of the
wall. They were very small; but close beside
them all the time stood a much larger figure
which seemed to be directing their movements.
There was no need to look twice; it was impossible
to mistake these terrible little people
and their hideous overseer. Horror rushed
over the boy, and a wild scream was out in the
night before he could possibly prevent it. At
the same moment a cloud passed over the
face of the moon and the yard was shrouded in
darkness.</p>

<p>A minute later the cloud passed off; but
while it was still too dark to see clearly,
Jimbo was conscious of a rushing, whispering
sound in the air, and something went past
him at a tremendous pace into the sky. The
wind stirred his hair as it passed, and a moment
later he heard voices far away in the distance&mdash;up
in the sky or within the house he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
not tell&mdash;singing mournfully the song he now
knew so well:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We dance with phantoms and with shadows play.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But when he looked down at the yard he
saw that it was deserted, and the corner by
the little upright stones lay in the clear moonlight,
empty of figures, large or small.</p>

<p>Shivering with fright, he flew across to the
window ledge, and almost tumbled into the
arms of the governess who was standing close
inside.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, child?" she asked in
a voice that trembled a little.</p>

<p>And, still shuddering, he told her how he
thought he had seen the children working by
the gravestones. All her efforts to calm him
at first failed, but after a bit she drew his
thoughts to pleasanter things, and he was
not so certain after all that he had not been
deceived by the cunning of the moonlight and
the shadows.</p>

<p>A long interval passed, and no further sign
was given by the owner of the house or his
band of frightened children. Jimbo soon lost
himself again in the delights of flying and the
joy of his increasing powers.</p>

<p>Most of all he enjoyed the quiet, starlit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
nights before the moon was up; for the moon
dazzled the eyes in the rarefied air where they
flew, whereas the stars gave just enough light
to steer by without making it uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Moreover, the moon often filled him with a
kind of faint terror, as of death; he could
never gaze at her white face for long without
feeling that something entered his heart with
those silver rays&mdash;something that boded him
no good. He never spoke of this to the governess;
indeed, he only recognised it himself
when the moon was near the full; but it lay
always in the depths of his being, and he felt
dimly that it would have to be reckoned with
before he could really escape for good. He
took no liberties when the moon was at the full.</p>

<p>He loved to hover&mdash;for he had learned by
this time that most difficult of all flying feats;
to hold the body vertical and whirr the wings
without rising or advancing&mdash;he loved to
hover on windless nights over ponds and rivers
and see the stars reflected in their still pools.
Indeed, sometimes he hovered till he dropped,
and only saved himself from a wetting by
sweeping up in a tremendous curve along the
surface of the water, and thus up into the
branches of the trees where the governess sat
waiting for him. And then, after a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
rest, they would launch forth again and fly
over fields and woods, sometimes even as far
as the hills that ran down the coast of the sea
itself.</p>

<p>They usually flew at a height of about a
thousand feet, and the earth passed beneath
them like a great streaked shadow. But as
soon as the moon was up the whole country
turned into a fairyland of wonder. Her light
touched the woods with a softened magic,
and the fields and hedges became frosted most
delicately. Beneath a thin transparency of
mist the water shone with a silvery brilliance
that always enabled them to distinguish it
from the land at any height; while the farms
and country houses were swathed in tender
grey shadows through which the trees and
chimneys pierced in slender lines of black. It
was wonderful to watch the shadows everywhere
spinning their blue veil of distance that
lent even to the commonest objects something
of enchantment and mystery.</p>

<p>Those were wonderful journeys they made
together into the pathways of the silent night,
along the unknown courses, into that hushed
centre where they could almost hear the
beatings of her great heart&mdash;like winged
thoughts searching the huge vault, till the boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
ached with the sensations of speed and distance,
and the old yellow moon seemed to
stagger across the sky.</p>

<p>Sometimes they rose very high into freezing
air, so high that the earth became a dull
shadow specked with light. They saw the
trains running in all directions with thin
threads of smoke shining in the glare of the
open fire-boxes. But they seemed very tiny
trains indeed, and stirred in him no recollections
of the semi-annual visits to London town
when he went to the dentist, and lunched with
the dreaded grandmother or the stiff and
fashionable aunts.</p>

<p>And when they came down again from
these perilous heights, the scents of the earth
rose to meet them, the perfume of woods and
fields, and the smells of the open country.</p>

<p>There was, too, the delight, the curious
delight of windy nights, when the wind smote
and buffeted them, knocking them suddenly
sideways, whistling through their feathers as
if it wanted to tear them from their sockets;
rushing furiously up underneath their wings
with repeated blows; turning them round,
and backwards and forwards, washing them
from head to foot in a tempestuous sea of
rapid and unexpected motion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p><p>It was, of course, far easier to fly with a
wind than without one. The difficulty with a
violent wind was to get down&mdash;not to keep
up. The gusts drove up against the under-surfaces
of their wings and kept them afloat,
so that by merely spreading them like sails
they could sweep and circle without a single
stroke. Jimbo soon learned to manœuvre so
that he could turn the strength of a great wind
to his own purposes, and revel in its boisterous
waves and currents like a strong swimmer in
a rough sea.</p>

<p>And to listen to the wind as it swept backwards
and forwards over the surface of the
earth below was another pleasure; for everything
it touched gave out a definite note. He
soon got to know the long sad cry from the
willows, and the little whispering in the tops
of the poplar trees; the crisp, silvery rattle
of the birches, and the deep roar from oaks
and beech woods. The sound of a forest was
like the shouting of the sea.</p>

<p>But far more lovely, when they descended
a little, and the wind was more gentle, were
the low pipings among the reeds and the
little wayward murmurs under the hedgerows.</p>

<p>The pine trees, however, drew them most,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
with their weird voices, now far away, now
near, rising upwards with a wind of sighs.</p>

<p>There was a grove of these trees that
trooped down to the waters of a little lake in
the hills, and to this spot they often flew when
the wind was low and the music likely, therefore,
to be to their taste. For, even when there
was no perceptible wind, these trees seemed
always full of mysterious, mournful whisperings;
their branches held soft music that
never quite died away, even when all other
trees were silent and motionless.</p>

<p>Besides these special expeditions, they flew
everywhere and anywhere. They visited the
birds in their nests in lofty trees, and exchanged
the time of night with wise-eyed owls staring
out upon them from the ivy. They hovered
up the face of great cliffs, and passed the
hawks asleep on perilous ledges; skimmed
over lonely marshes, frightening the water-birds
paddling in and out among the reeds.
They followed the windings of streams, singing
among the meadows, and flew along the wet
sands as they watched the moon rise out of
the sea.</p>

<p>These flights were unadulterated pleasure,
and Jimbo thought he could never have
enough of them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p><p>He soon began to notice, too, that the trees
emanated something that affected his own
condition. When he sat in their branches this
was very noticeable. Currents of force passed
from them into himself. And even when he
flew over their crests he was aware that some
woods exhaled vigorous, life-giving forces,
while others tired and depleted him. Nothing
was visible actually, but fine waves seemed
to beat up against his eyes and thoughts,
making him stronger or weaker, happy or
melancholy, full of hope and courage, or listless
and indifferent.</p>

<p>These emanations of the trees&mdash;this giving-forth
of their own personal forces&mdash;were, of
course, very varied in strength and character.
Oaks and pines were the best combination,
he found, before the stress of a long flight, the
former giving him steadiness, and the latter
steely endurance and the power to steer in
sinuous, swift curves, without taking thought
or trouble.</p>

<p>Other trees gave other powers. All gave
something. It was impossible to sit among
their branches without absorbing some of the
subtle and exhilarating tree-life. He soon
learned how to gather it all into himself, and
turn it to account in his own being.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p><p>"Sit quietly," the governess said. "Let
the forces creep in and stir about. Do nothing
yourself. Give them time to become part of
yourself and mix properly with your own
currents. Effort on your part prevents this,
and you weaken them without gaining anything
yourself."</p>

<p>Jimbo made all sorts of experiments with
trees and rocks and water and fields, learning
gradually the different qualities of force they
gave forth, and how to use them for himself.
Nothing, he found, was really dead. And
sometimes he got himself into strange difficulties
in the beginning of his attempts to
master and absorb these nature-forces.</p>

<p>"Remember," the governess warned him
more than once, when he was inclined to play
tricks, "they are in quite a different world to
ours. You cannot take liberties with them.
Even a sympathetic soul like yourself only
touches the fringe of their world. You exchange
surface-messages with them, nothing
more. Some trees have terrible forces just
below the surface. They could extinguish
you altogether&mdash;absorb you into themselves.
Others are naturally hostile. Some are mere
tricksters. Others are shifty and treacherous,
like the hollies, that move about too much.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The oak and the pine and the elm are friendly,
and you can always trust them absolutely.
But there are others&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>She held up a warning finger, and Jimbo's
eyes nearly dropped out of his head.</p>

<p>"No," she added, in reply to his questions,
"you can't learn all this at once. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"
She hesitated a little. "Perhaps, if you don't
escape, we should have time for all manner of
adventures among the trees and other things&mdash;but
then, we <em>are</em> going to escape, so there's no
good wasting time over <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="chapsub">AN ADVENTURE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Miss Lake did not always accompany
him on these excursions into the night; sometimes
he took long flights by himself, and
she rather encouraged him in this, saying it
would give him confidence in case he ever
lost her and was obliged to find his way
about alone.</p>

<p>"But I couldn't get really lost," he said
once to her. "I know the winds perfectly
now and the country round for miles, and I
never go out in fog&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But these are only practice flights," she
replied. "The flight of escape is a very
different matter. I want you to learn all you
possibly can so as to be prepared for anything."</p>

<p>Jimbo felt vaguely uncomfortable when she
talked like this.</p>

<p>"But you'll be with me in the Escape
Flight&mdash;the final one of all," he said; "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
nothing ever goes wrong when you're with
me."</p>

<p>"I should like to be always with you," she
answered tenderly, "but it's well to be prepared
for anything, just the same."</p>

<p>And more than this the boy could never get
out of her.</p>

<p>On one of these lonely flights, however, he
made the unpleasant discovery that he was
being followed.</p>

<p>At first he only imagined there was somebody
after him because of the curious vibrations
of the very rarefied air in which he flew.
Every time his flight slackened and the noise
of his own wings grew less, there reached him
from some other corner of the sky a sound like
the vibrations of large wings beating the air.
It seemed behind, and generally below him,
but the swishing of his own feathers made it
difficult to hear with distinctness, or to be
certain of the direction.</p>

<p>Evidently it was a long way off; but now
and again, when he took a spurt and then
sailed silently for several minutes on outstretched
wings, the beating of distant, following
feathers seemed unmistakably clear, and
he raced on again at full speed more than
terrified. Other times, however, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
tried to listen, there was no trace of this other
flyer, and then his fear would disappear, and
he would persuade himself that it had been
imagination. So much on these flights he
knew to be imagination&mdash;the sentences, voices,
and laughter, for instance, that filled the air
and sounded so real, yet were actually caused
by the wind rushing past his ears, the rhythm of
the wing-beats, and the tips of the feathers occasionally
rubbing against the sides of his body.</p>

<p>But at last one night the suspicion that he
was followed became a certainty.</p>

<p>He was flying far up in the sky, passing
over some big city, when the sound rose to
his ears, and he paused, sailing on stretched
wings, to listen. Looking down into the immense
space below, he saw, plainly outlined
against the luminous patch above the city,
the form of a large flying creature moving by
with rapid strokes. The pulsations of its
great wings made the air tremble so that he
both heard and felt them. It may have been
that the vapours of the city distorted the
thing, just as the earth's atmosphere magnifies
the rising or setting of the moon; but, even
so, it was easy to see that it was something a
good deal larger than himself, and with a much
more powerful flight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p><p>Fortunately, it did not seem this time to be
actually on his trail, for it swept by at a great
pace, and was soon lost in the darkness far
ahead. Perhaps it was only searching for
him, and his great height had proved his
safety. But in any case he was exceedingly
terrified, and at once turned round, pointed
his head for the earth, and shot downwards
in the direction of the Empty House as fast
as ever he could.</p>

<p>But when he spoke to the governess she made
light of it, and told him there was nothing to
be afraid of. It might have been a flock of
hurrying night-birds, she said, or an owl distorted
by the city's light, or even his own
reflection magnified in water. Anyhow, she
felt sure it was not chasing him, and he need
pay no attention to it.</p>

<p>Jimbo felt reassured, but not quite satisfied.
He knew a flying monster when he saw one;
and it was only when he had been for many
more flights alone, without its reappearance,
that his confidence was fully restored, and he
began to forget about it.</p>

<p>Certainly these lonely flights were very
much to his taste. His Older Self, with its
dim hauntings of a great memory somewhere
behind him, took possession then, and he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
able to commune with nature in a way that
the presence of the governess made impossible.
With her his Older Self rarely showed itself
above the surface for long; he was always the
child. But, when alone, Nature became
alive; he drew force from the trees and
flowers, and felt that they all shared a common
life together. Had he been imprisoned by
some wizard of old in a tree-form, knowing of
the sunset and the dawn only by the sweet
messages that rustled in his branches, the
wind could hardly have spoken to him with a
more intimate meaning; or the life of the
fields, eternally patient, have touched him
more nearly with their joys and sorrows. It
seemed almost as if, from his leafy cell, he
had gazed before this into the shining pools
with which the summer rains jewelled the
meadows, sending his soul in a stream of
unsatisfied yearning up to the stars. It all
came back dimly when he heard the wind
among the leaves, and carried him off to the
woods and fields of an existence far antedating
this one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And on gentle nights, when the wind itself
was half asleep and dreaming, the pine trees
drew him most of all, for theirs was the song
he loved above all others. He would fly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
round and round the little grove by the mountain
lake, listening for hours together to their
sighing voices. But the governess was never
told of this, whatever she may have guessed;
for it seemed to him a joy too deep for words,
the pains and sweetness being mingled too
mysteriously for him ever to express in
awkward sentences. Moreover, it all passed
away and was forgotten the moment the child
took possession and usurped the older memory.</p>

<p>One night, when the moon was high and the
air was cool and fragrant after the heat of the
day, Jimbo felt a strong desire to get off by
himself for a long flight. He was full of
energy, and the space-craving cried to be
satisfied. For several days he had been
content with slow, stupid expeditions with
the governess.</p>

<p>"I'm off alone to-night," he cried, balancing
on the window ledge, "but I'll be back before
dawn. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>She kissed him, as she always did now, and
with her good-bye ringing in his ears, he
dropped from the window and rose rapidly
over the elms and away from earth.</p>

<p>This night, for some reason, the stars and
the moon seemed to draw him, and with
tireless wings he mounted up, up, up, to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
height he had never reached before. The
intoxication of the strong night air rose into
his brain and he dashed forward ever faster,
with a mad delight, into the endless space
before him.</p>

<p>Mile upon mile lay behind him as he rushed
onwards, always pointing a little on the
upward slope, drunk with speed. The earth
faded away to a dark expanse of shadow
beneath him, and he no longer was conscious
of the deep murmur that usually flowed
steadily upwards from its surface. He had
often before risen out of reach of the earth
noises, but never so far that this dull reverberating
sound, combined of all the voices of
the world merged together, failed to make
itself heard. To-night, however, he heard
nothing. The stars above his head changed
from yellow to diamond white, and the cold
air stung his cheeks and brought the water
to his eyes.</p>

<p>But at length the governess's warning, as
he explored these forbidden regions, came
back to him, and in a series of gigantic bounds
that took his breath away completely, he
dropped nearer to the earth again and kept
on at a much lower level.</p>

<p>The hours passed and the position of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
moon began to alter noticeably. Some of the
constellations that were overhead when he
started were now dipping below the horizon.
Never before had he ventured so far from home,
and he began to realise that he had been
flying much longer than he knew or intended.
The speed had been terrific.</p>

<p>The change came imperceptibly. With the
discovery that his wings were not moving
quite so easily as before, he became suddenly
aware that this had really been the case for
some little time. He was flying with greater
effort, and for a long time this effort had been
increasing gradually before he actually recognised
the fact.</p>

<p>Although no longer pointing towards the
earth he seemed to be sinking. It became
increasingly difficult to fly upwards. His
wings did not seem to fail or weaken, nor was
he conscious of feeling tired; but something
was ever persuading him to fly lower, almost
as if a million tiny threads were coaxing him
downwards, drawing him gradually nearer to
the world again. Whatever it was, the earth
had come much closer to him in the last hour,
and its familiar voices were pleasant to hear
after the boundless heights he had just
left.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p><p>But for some reason his speed grew insensibly
less and less. His wings moved
apparently as fast as before, but it was harder
to keep up. In spite of himself he kept
sinking. The sensation was quite new, and he
could not understand it. It almost seemed
as though he were being <em>pulled</em> downwards.</p>

<p>Jimbo began to feel uneasy. He had not
lost his bearings, but he was a very long way
from home, and quite beyond reach of the help
he was so accustomed to. With a great effort
he mounted several hundred feet into the air,
and tried hard to stay there. For a short
time he succeeded, but he soon felt himself
sinking gradually downwards again. The
force drawing him was a constant force without
rise or fall; and with a deadly feeling of
fear the boy began to realise that he would
soon have to yield to it altogether. His heart
beat faster and his thoughts turned to the
friend who was then far away, but who alone
could save him.</p>

<p>She, at least, could have explained it and
told him what best to do. But the governess
was beyond his reach. This problem he must
face alone.</p>

<p>Something, however, had to be done quickly,
and Jimbo, acting more as the man than as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the boy, turned and flew hurriedly forward
in another direction. He hoped this might
somehow counteract the force that still drew
him downwards; and for a time it apparently
did so, and he flew level. But the strain
increased every minute, and he looked down
with something of a shudder as he realised
that before very long he would be obliged to
yield to this deadly force&mdash;and drop!</p>

<p>It was then for the first time he noticed a
change had come over the surface of the earth
below. Instead of the patchwork of field and
wood and road, he saw a vast cloud stretching
out, white and smooth in the moonlight. The
world was hidden beneath a snowy fog, dense
and impenetrable. It was no longer even
possible to tell in what direction he was
flying, for there was nothing to steer by.
This was a new and unexpected complication,
and the boy could not understand how the
change had come about so quickly; the last
time he had glanced down for indications to
steer by, everything had been clear and easily
visible.</p>

<p>It was very beautiful, this carpet of white
mist with the silver moon shining upon it,
but it thrilled him now with an unpleasant
sense of dread. And, still more unpleasant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was a new sound which suddenly broke in
upon the stillness and turned his blood into
ice. He was certain that he heard wings
behind him. He was being followed, and this
meant that it was impossible to turn and fly
back.</p>

<p>There was nothing now to do but fly forwards
and hope to distance the huge wings;
but if he was being followed by the powerful
flyer he had seen a few nights before, the boy
knew that he stood little chance of success,
and he only did it because it seemed the one
thing possible.</p>

<p>The cloud was dense and chill as he entered
it; its moisture clung to his wings and made
them heavy; his muscles seemed to stiffen,
and motion became more and more difficult.
The wings behind him meanwhile came closer.</p>

<p>He was flying along the surface of the mist
now, his body and wings hidden, and his head
just above the level. He could see along its
white, even top. If he sank a few more
inches it would be impossible to see at all, or
even to judge where he was going. Soon it
rose level with his lips, and at the same time
he noticed a new smell in the air, faint at first,
but growing every moment stronger. It was
a fresh, sweet odour, yet it somehow added to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
his alarm, and stirred in him new centres of
uneasiness. He tried vainly to increase his
speed and distance the wings which continued
to gain so steadily upon him from behind.</p>

<p>The cloud, apparently, was not everywhere
of the same density, for here and there he saw
the tops of green hills below him as he flew.
But he could not understand why each green
hill seemed to have a little lake on its summit&mdash;a
little lake in which the reflected moon stared
straight up into his face. Nor could he quite
make out what the sounds were which rose
to his ears through the muffling of the cloud&mdash;sounds
of tumultuous rushing, hissing, and
tumbling. They were continuous, these
sounds, and once or twice he thought he
heard with them a deep, thunderous roar that
almost made his heart stop beating as he
listened.</p>

<p>Was he, perhaps, over a range of high
mountains, and was this the sound of the
tumbling torrents?</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, it came to him with a shock
that the ordinary sounds of the earth had
wholly ceased.</p>

<p>Jimbo felt his head beginning to whirl. He
grew weaker every minute; less able to offer
resistance to the remorseless forces that were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
sucking him down. Now the mist had closed
over his head, and he could no longer see the
moonlight. He turned again, shaking with
terror, and drove forward headlong through
the clinging vapour. A sensation of choking
rose in his throat; he was tired out, ready
to drop with exhaustion. The wings of the
following creature were now so close that he
thought every minute he would be seized
from behind and plunged into the abyss to
his death.</p>

<p>It was just then that he made the awful
discovery that the world below him was not
stationary: the <em>green hills were moving</em>. They
were sweeping past with a rushing, thundering
sound in regular procession; and their huge
sides were streaked with white. The reflection
of the moon leaped up into his face as
each hill rolled hissing and gurgling by, and
he knew at last with a shock of unutterable
horror that it was <em class="ucsmcap">THE SEA</em>!</p>

<p>He was flying over the sea, and the waters
were drawing him down. The immense, green
waves that rolled along through the sea fog,
carrying the moon's face on their crests,
foaming and gurgling as they went, were
already leaping up to seize him by the feet
and drag him into their depths.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p><p>He dropped several feet deeper into the
mist, and towards the sea, terror-stricken and
blinded. Then, turning frantically, not knowing
what else to do, he struck out, with his
last strength, for the upper surface and the
moonlight. But as he did so, turning his
face towards the sky he saw a dark form
hovering just above him, covering his retreat
with huge outstretched wings. It was too
late; he was hemmed in on all sides.</p>

<p>At that moment a huge, rolling wave,
bigger than all the rest, swept past and wet
him to the knees. His heart failed him. The
next wave would cover him. Already it was
rushing towards him with foaming crest. He
was in its shadow; he heard its thunder.
Darkness rushed over him&mdash;he saw the vast
sides streaked with grey and white&mdash;when
suddenly, the owner of the wings plucked him
in the back, mid-way between the shoulders,
and lifted him bodily out of the fog, so that
the wave swept by without even wetting his
feet.</p>

<p>The next minute he saw a dim, white sheet
of silvery mist at his feet, and found himself
far above it in the sweet, clean moonlight;
and when he turned, almost dead with terror,
to look upon his captor, he found himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
looking straight into the eyes of&mdash;the
governess.</p>

<p>The sense of relief was so great that Jimbo
simply closed his wings, and hung, a dead
weight, in the air.</p>

<p>"Use your wings!" cried the governess
sharply; and, still holding him, while he began
to flap feebly, she turned and flew in the
direction of the land.</p>

<p>"You!" he gasped at last. "It was you
following me!"</p>

<p>"Of course it was me! I never let you out
of my sight. I've always followed you&mdash;every
time you've been out alone."</p>

<p>Jimbo was still conscious of the drawing
power of the sea, but he felt that his companion
was too strong for it. After fifteen
minutes of fierce flight he heard the sounds
of earth again, and knew that they were
safe.</p>

<p>Then the governess loosened her hold, and
they flew along side by side in the direction
of home.</p>

<p>"I won't scold you, Jimbo," she said
presently, "for you've suffered enough
already." She was the first to break the
silence, and her voice trembled a little. "But
remember, the sea draws you down, just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
surely as the moon draws you up. Nothing
would please Him better than to see you
destroyed by one or the other."</p>

<p>Jimbo said nothing. But, when once they
were safe inside the room again, he went up
and cried his eyes out on her arm, while she
folded him in to her heart as if he were the
only thing in the whole world she had to
love.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="chapsub">THE CALL OF THE BODY</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> night, towards the end of the practice
flights, a strange thing happened, which
showed that the time for the final flight of
escape was drawing near.</p>

<p>They had been out for several hours flying
through a rainstorm, the thousand little drops
of which stung their faces like tiny gun-shot.
About two in the morning the wind shifted
and drove the clouds away as by magic; the
stars came out, at first like the eyes of children
still dim with crying, but later with a clear
brilliance that filled Jimbo and the governess
with keen pleasure. The air was washed and
perfumed; the night luminous, alive, singing.
All its tenderness and passion entered their
hearts and filled them with the wonder of its
glory.</p>

<p>"Come down, Jimbo," said the governess,
"and we'll lie in the trees and smell the air
after the rain."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p><p>"Yes," added the boy, whose Older Self
had been whispering mysterious things to him,
"and watch the stars and hear them singing."</p>

<p>He led the way to some beech trees that
lined a secluded lane, and settled himself comfortably
in the top branches of the largest,
while the governess soon found a resting-place
beside him. It was a deserted spot, far from
human habitation. Here and there through
the foliage they could see little pools of rain-water
reflecting the sky. The group of trees
swung in the wind, dreaming great woodland
dreams, and overhead the stars looked like a
thousand orchards in the sky, filling the air
with the radiance of their blossoms.</p>

<p>"How brilliant they are to-night," said the
governess, after watching the boy attentively
for some minutes as they lay side by side in the
great forked branch. "I never saw the
constellations so clear."</p>

<p>"But they have so little shape," he answered
dreamily; "if we wore lights when we flew
about we should make much better constellations
than they do."</p>

<p>"The Big and Little Child instead of the
Big and Little Bear," she laughed, still
watching him.</p>

<p>"I'm slipping away&mdash;&mdash;" he began, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
then stopped suddenly. He saw the expression
of his companion's eyes, which were
looking him through and through with the
most poignant love and yearning mingled in
their gaze, and something clutched at his
heart that he could not understand.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;not slipping out of the tree," he went
on vaguely, "but slipping into some new
place or condition. I don't understand it.
Am I&mdash;going off somewhere&mdash;where you can't
follow? I thought suddenly&mdash;I was losing you."</p>

<p>The governess smiled at him sadly and said
nothing. She stroked his wings and then
raised them to her lips and kissed them.
Jimbo watched her, and folded his other wing
across into her hands; he felt unhappy, and
his heart began to swell within him; but he
didn't know what to say, and the Older Self
began slowly to fade away again.</p>

<p>"But the stars," he went on, "have they
got things they send out too&mdash;forces, I mean,
like the trees? Do they send out something
that makes us feel sad, or happy, or strong,
or weak?"</p>

<p>She did not answer for some time; she lay
watching his face and fondling his smooth
red wings; and, presently, when she did
begin to explain, Jimbo found that the child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in him was then paramount again, and he
could not quite follow what she said.</p>

<p>He tried to answer properly and seem
interested, but her words were very long and
hard to understand, and after a time he thought
she was talking to herself more than to him,
and he gave up all serious effort to follow.
Then he became aware that her voice had
changed. The words seemed to drop down
upon him from a great height. He imagined
she was standing on one of those far stars he
had been asking about, and was shouting at
him through an immense tube of sky and
darkness. The words pricked his ears like
needle-points, only he no longer heard them
as words, but as tiny explosions of sound,
meaningless and distant. Swift flashes of
light began to dance before his eyes, and
suddenly from underneath the tree, a wind
rose up and rushed, laughing, across his face.
Darkness in a mass dropped over his eyes,
and he sank backwards somewhere into another
corner of space altogether.</p>

<p>The governess, meanwhile, lay quite still,
watching the limp form in the branches beside
her and still holding the tips of his red wings.
Presently tears stole into her eyes, and began
to run down her cheeks. One deep sigh after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
another escaped from her lips; but the little
boy, or the old soul, who was the cause of all
her emotion, apparently was far away and
knew nothing of it. For a long time she lay
in silence, and then leaned a little nearer to
him, so as to see his full face. The eyes were
wide open and staring, but they were looking
at nothing she could see, for the consciousness
cannot be in two places at the same time, and
Jimbo just then was off on a little journey
of his own, a journey that was but preliminary
to the great final one of all.</p>

<p>"Jimbo," whispered the girl between her
tears and sighs, "Jimbo! Where have you
gone to? Tell me, are they getting ready
for you at last, and am I to lose you after
all? Is this the only way I can save you&mdash;by
losing you?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, no sign of movement;
and the governess hid her face in her hands
and cried quietly to herself, while her tears
dropped down through the branches of the
tree and fell into the rain-pools beneath.</p>

<p>For Jimbo's state of oblivion in the tree
was in reality a momentary return to consciousness
in his body on the bed, and the
repaired mechanism of the brain and muscles
had summoned him back on a sort of trial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
visit. He remembered nothing of it afterwards,
any more than one remembers the
experiences of deep sleep; but the fact was
that, with the descent of the darkness upon
him in the branches, he had opened his eyes
once again on the scene in the night-nursery
bedroom where his body lay.</p>

<p>He saw figures standing round the bed and
about the room; his mother with the same
white face as before, was still bending over
the bed asking him if he knew her; a tall man
in a long black coat moved noiselessly to and
fro; and he saw a shaded lamp on a table a
little to the right of the bed. Nothing seemed
to have changed very much, though there had
probably been time enough since he last
opened his eyes for the black-coated doctor
to have gone and come again for a second
visit. He held an instrument in his hands
that shone brightly in the lamplight. Jimbo
saw this plainly and wondered what it was.
He felt as if he were just waking out of a nice,
deep sleep&mdash;dreamless and undisturbed. The
Empty House, the Governess, Fright and the
Children had all vanished from his memory,
and he knew no more about wings and feathers
than he did about the science of meteorology.</p>

<p>But the bedroom scene was a mere glimpse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
after all; his eyes were already beginning to
close again. First they shut out the figure of
the doctor; then the bed-curtains; and then
the nurse moved her arm, making the whole
scene quiver for an instant, like some huge
jelly-shape, before it dipped into profound
darkness and disappeared altogether. His
mother's voice ran off into a thin trickle of
sound, miles and miles away, and the light
from the lamp followed him with its glare for
less than half a second. All had vanished.</p>

<p>"Jimbo, dear, where have you been? Can
you remember anything?" asked the soft
voice beside him, as he looked first at the stars
overhead, and then from the tracery of branches
and leaves beneath him to the great sea of
tree-tops and open country all round.</p>

<p>But he could tell her nothing; he seemed
dreamy and absent-minded, lying and staring
at her as if he hardly knew who she was or
what she was saying. His mind was still
hovering near the border-line of the two
states of consciousness, like the region between
sleeping and waking, where both worlds seem
unreal and wholly wonderful.</p>

<p>He could not answer her questions, but he
evidently caught some reflex of her emotions,
for he leaned towards her across the branches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and said he was happy and never wanted to
leave her. Then he crawled to the end of the
big bough and sprang out into the air with a
shout of delight. He was the child again&mdash;the
flying child, wild with the excitement of
tearing through the night air at fifty miles
an hour.</p>

<p>The governess soon followed him and they
flew home together, taking a long turn by the
sea and past the great chalk cliffs, where the
sea sang loud beneath them.</p>

<p>These lapses became with time more frequent,
as well as of longer duration; and with
them the boy noticed that the longing to
escape became once again intense. He wanted
<em>to get home</em>, wherever home was; he experienced
a sort of nostalgia for the body, though
he could not remember where that body lay.
But when he asked the governess what this
feeling meant, she only mystified him by her
answers, saying that every one, in the body
or out of it, felt a deep longing for their final
<em>home</em>, though they might not have the least
idea where it lay, or even to be able to recognise,
much less to label, their longing.</p>

<p>His normal feelings, too, were slowly returning
to him. The Older Self became more and
more submerged. As he approached the state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of ordinary, superficial consciousness, the
characteristics of that state reflected themselves
more and more in his thoughts and
feelings. His memory still remained a complete
blank; but he somehow felt that the
things, places, and people he wanted to
remember, had moved much nearer to him
than before. Every day brought them more
within his reach.</p>

<p>"All these forgotten things will come back to
me soon, I know," he said one day to the governess,
"and then I'll tell you all about them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll remember me too then,"
she answered, a shadow passing across her face.</p>

<p>Jimbo clapped his hands with delight.</p>

<p>"Oh," he cried, "I should like to remember
you, because that would make you a sort of
two-people governess, and I should love you
twice as much."</p>

<p>But with the gradual return to former conditions
the feelings of age and experience grew
dim and indefinite, his knowledge lessened,
becoming obscure and confused, showing itself
only in vague impressions and impulses, until
at last it became quite the exception for the
child-consciousness to be broken through by
flashes of intuition and inspiration from the
more deeply hidden memories.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p><p>For one thing, the deep horror of the
Empty House and its owner now returned to
him with full force. Fear settled down again
over the room, and lurked in the shadows
over the yard. A vivid dread seized him of
the <em>other door</em> in the room&mdash;the door through
which the Frightened Children had disappeared,
but which had never opened since. It gradually
became for him a personality in the room,
a staring, silent, listening thing, always watching,
always waiting. One day it would open
and he would be caught! In a dozen ways
like this the horror of the house entered his
heart and made him long for escape with all
the force of his being.</p>

<p>But the governess, too, seemed changing;
she was becoming more vague and more
mysterious. Her face was always sad now,
and her eyes wistful; her manner became
restless and uneasy, and in many little ways
the child could not fail to notice that her mind
was intent upon other things. He begged
her to name the day for the final flight, but
she always seemed to have some good excuse
for putting it off.</p>

<p>"I feel frightened when you don't tell me
what's going on," he said to her.</p>

<p>"It's the preparations for the last flight,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
she answered, "the flight of escape. He'll
try to prevent us going together so that you
should get lost. But it's better you shouldn't
know too much," she added. "Trust me and
have patience."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what you're so afraid of," he
said, "<em>separation</em>!" He was very proud
indeed of the long word, and said it over several
times to himself.</p>

<p>And the governess, looking out of the
window at the fading sunlight, repeated to
herself more than to him the word he was so
proud of.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I'm so afraid of&mdash;separation;
but if it means your salvation&mdash;&mdash;"
and her sentence remained unfinished
as her eyes wandered far above the
tops of the trees into the shadows of the sky.</p>

<p>And Jimbo, drawn by the sadness of her
voice, turned towards the window and noticed
to his utter amazement that he could <em>see right
through her</em>. He could see the branches of
the trees <em>beyond</em> her body.</p>

<p>But the next instant she turned and was no
longer transparent, and before the boy could
say a word, she crossed the floor and disappeared
from the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="chapsub">PREPARATION</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that he was preparing to leave it, Jimbo
began to realise more fully how things in this
world of delirium&mdash;so the governess sometimes
called it&mdash;were all terribly out of order and
confused. So long as he was wholly in it and
of it, everything had seemed all right; but,
as he approached his normal condition again,
the disorder became more and more apparent.</p>

<p>And the next few hours brought it home
with startling clearness, and increased to
fever heat the desire for final escape.</p>

<p>It was not so much a nonsense-world&mdash;it
was too alarming for that&mdash;as a world of nightmare,
wherein everything was distorted.
Events in it were all out of proportion; effects
no longer sprang from adequate causes;
things happened in a dislocated sort of way,
and there was no sequence in the order of their
happening. Tiny occurrences filled him with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
disproportionate, inconceivable horror; and
great events, on the other hand, passed him
scathless. The spirit of disorder&mdash;monstrous,
uncouth, terrifying&mdash;reigned supreme; and
Jimbo's whole desire, though inarticulate,
was to escape back into order and harmony
again.</p>

<p>In contrast to all this dreadful uncertainty,
the conduct of the governess stood out alone
as the one thing he could count upon: she
was sure and unfailing; he felt absolute confidence
in her plans for his safety, and when
he thought of her his mind was at rest. Come
what might, she would always be there in time
to help. The adventure over the sea had
proved that; but, childlike, he thought
chiefly of his own safety, and had ceased to
care very much whether she escaped with him
or not. It was the older Jimbo that preferred
captivity to escape without her, whereas every
minute now he was sinking deeper into the
normal child state in which the intuitive
flashes from the buried soul became more and
more rare.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there was preparation going on,
secret and mysterious. He could feel it.
Some one else besides the governess was
making plans, and the boy began to dread the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
moment of escape almost as much as he
desired it. The alternative appalled him&mdash;to
live for ever in the horror of this house,
bounded by the narrow yard, watched by
Fright listening ever at his elbow, and visited
by the horrible Frightened Children. Even
the governess herself began to inspire him with
something akin to fear, as her personality
grew more and more mysterious. He thought
of her as she stood by the window, with the
branches of the tree visible through her body,
and the thought filled him with a dreadful
and haunting distress.</p>

<p>But this was only when she was absent;
the moment she came into the room, and he
looked into her kind eyes, the old feeling
of security returned, and he felt safe and happy.</p>

<p>Once, during the day, she came up to see
him, and this time with final instructions.
Jimbo listened with rapt attention.</p>

<p>"To-night, or to-morrow night we start,"
she said in a quiet voice. "You must wait till
you hear me calling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But sha'n't we start together?" he
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," she replied. "I'm doing
everything possible to put him off the scent,
but it's not easy, for once Fright knows you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
he's always on the watch. Even if he can't
prevent your escape, he'll try to send you
home to your body with such a shock that
you'll be only 'half there' for the rest of
your life."</p>

<p>Jimbo did not quite understand what she
meant by this, and returned at once to the
main point.</p>

<p>"Then the moment you call I'm to start?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I shall be outside somewhere. It
depends on the wind and weather a little, but
probably I shall be hovering above the trees.
You must dash out of the window and join
me the moment you hear me call. Clear the
wall without sinking into the yard, and
mind he doesn't tear your wings off as you
fly by."</p>

<p>"What will happen, though, if I don't find
you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You might get lost. If he succeeds in
getting me out of the way first, you're sure to
get lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I've had long flights without getting
lost," he objected.</p>

<p>"Nothing to this one," she replied. "It
will be tremendous. You see, Jimbo, it's not
only distance; it's change of condition as
well."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p><p>"I don't mind what it is so long as we escape
together," he said, puzzled by her words.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes fixed on her face. It
seemed to him she was changing even as he
looked at her. A sort of veil lifted from her
features. He fancied he could see the shape
of the door through her body.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Miss Lake&mdash;&mdash;" he began in
a frightened voice, taking a step towards her.
"What is the matter? You look so different!"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dearest boy, is the matter," she
replied faintly. "I feel sad at the thought of
your&mdash;of our going, that's all. But that's
nothing," she added more briskly, "and
remember, I've told you exactly what to do;
so you can't make any mistake. Now good-bye
for the present."</p>

<p>There was a smile on her face that he had
never seen there before, and an expression of
tenderness and love that he could not fail to
understand. But even as he looked she
seemed to fade away into a delicate, thin
shadow as she moved slowly towards the trap-door.
Jimbo stretched out his arms to touch
her, for the moment of dread had passed, and
he wanted to kiss her.</p>

<p>"No!" she cried sharply. "Don't touch
me, child; don't touch me!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p><p>But he was already close beside her, and in
another second would have had his arms
round her, when his foot stumbled over something,
and he fell forward into her with his
full weight. Instead of saving himself against
her body, however, he fell <em>clean through her</em>!
Nothing stopped him; there was no resistance;
he met nothing more solid than air, and fell
full length upon the floor. Before he could
recover from his surprise and pick himself
up, something touched him on the lips, and
he heard a voice that was faint as a whisper
saying, "Good-bye, darling child, and bless
you." The next moment he was on his feet
again and the room was empty. The governess
had gone through the trap-door, and he was
alone.</p>

<p>It was all very strange and confusing, and
he could not understand what was happening
to her. He never for a moment realised that
the change was in himself, and that as the tie
between himself and his body became closer,
the things of this other world he had been living
in for so long must fade gradually away into
shadows and emptiness.</p>

<p>But Jimbo was a brave boy; there was
nothing of the coward in him, though his
sensitive temperament made him sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
hesitate where an ordinary child with less
imagination would have acted promptly.
The desire to cry he thrust down and repressed,
fighting his depression by the thought that
within a few hours the voice might sound that
should call him to the excitement of the last
flight&mdash;and freedom.</p>

<p>The rest of the daylight slipped away very
quickly, and the room was full of shadows
almost before he knew it. Then came the
darkness. Outside, the wind rose and fell
fitfully, booming in the chimney with hollow
music, and sighing round the walls of the house.
A few stars peeped between the branches of
the elms, but masses of cloud hid most of the
sky, and the air felt heavy with coming rain.</p>

<p>He lay down on the bed and waited. At
the least sound he started, thinking it might
be the call from the governess. But the few
sounds he did hear always resolved themselves
into the moaning of the wind, and no voice
came. With his eyes on the open window,
trying to pierce the gloom and find the stars,
he lay motionless for hours, while the night
wore on and the shadows deepened.</p>

<p>And during those long hours of darkness
and silence he was conscious that a change
was going on within him. Name it he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
not, but somehow it made him feel that living
people like himself were standing near, trying
to speak, beckoning, anxious to bring him
back into their own particular world. The
darkness was so great that he could see only
the square outline of the open window, but
he felt sure that any sudden flash of light
would have revealed a group of persons round
his bed with arms outstretched, trying to
reach him. The emotion they roused in him
was not fear, for he felt sure they were kind,
and eager only to help him; and the more
he realised their presence, the less he thought
about the governess who had been doing so
much to make his escape possible.</p>

<p>Then, too, voices began to sound somewhere
in the air, but he could not tell whether
they were actually in the room, or outside
in the night, or only within himself&mdash;in his
own head:&mdash;strange, faint voices, whispering,
laughing, shouting, crying; fragments of
stories, rhymes, riddles, odd names of people
and places jostled one another with varying
degrees of clearness, now loud, now soft, till
he wondered what it all meant, and longed for
the light to come.</p>

<p>But besides all this, something else, too,
was abroad that night&mdash;something he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
not name or even think about without shaking
with terror down at the very roots of his being.
And when he thought of this, his heart called
loudly for the governess, and the people hidden
in the shadows of the room seemed quite
useless and unable to help.</p>

<p>Thus he hovered between the two worlds
and the two memories, phantoms and realities
shifting and changing places every few
minutes.</p>

<p>A little light would have saved him much
suffering. If only the moon were up! Moonlight
would have made all the difference.
Even a moon half hidden and misty would
have put the shadows farther away from him.</p>

<p>"Dear old misty moon!" he cried half
aloud to himself upon the bed, "why aren't
you here to-night? My last night!"</p>

<p>Misty Moon, Misty Moon! The words kept
ringing in his head. Misty Moon, Misty
Moon! They swam round in his blood in an
odd, tumultuous rhythm. Every time the
current of blood passed through his brain in
the course of its circulation it brought the
words with it, altered a little, and singing like
a voice.</p>

<p>Like a voice! Suddenly he made the
discovery that it actually <em>was</em> a voice&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
not his own. It was no longer the blood
singing in his veins, it was some one singing
outside the window. The sound began faintly
and far away, up above the trees; then it
came gradually nearer, only to die away again
almost to a whisper.</p>

<p>If it was not the voice of the governess, he
could only say it was a very good imitation
of it.</p>

<p>The words forming out of the empty air
rose and fell with the wind, and, taking his
thoughts, flung them in a stream through the
dark sky towards the hidden, misty moon:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"O misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear, misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nights are long without thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadows creep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across my sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fold their wings about me!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And another silvery voice, that might have
been the voice of a star, took it up faintly,
evidently from a much greater distance:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"O misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet, misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars are dim behind thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lo, thy beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spin through my dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weave a veil to blind me!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p><p>The sound of this beautiful voice so delighted
Jimbo that he sprang from his bed and rushed
to the window, hoping that he might be able
to hear it more clearly. But, before he got
half-way across the room, he stopped short,
trembling with terror. Underneath his very
feet, in the depths of the house, he heard the
awful voice he dreaded more than anything
else. It roared out the lines with a sound like
the rushing of a great river:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"O misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy songs are nightly driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sky to sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the old, grey Hills of Heaven!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And after the verse Jimbo heard a great peal
of laughter that seemed to shake the walls of
the house, and rooted his feet to the floor.
It rolled away with thundering echoes into
the very bowels of the earth. He just managed
to crawl back to his mattress and lie down,
when another voice took up the song, but this
time in accents so tender, that the child felt
something within him melt into tears of joy,
and he was on the verge of recognising, for
the first time since his accident, the voice of
his mother:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"O misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shy, misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence comes the blush that trembles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sweet disgrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er half thy face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Night her stars assembles?"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But his memory, of course, failed him just as
he seemed about to grasp it, and he was left
wondering why the sound of that one voice
had brought him a moment of radiant happiness
in the midst of so much horror and pain.
Meanwhile the answering voices went on,
each time different, and in new directions.</p>

<p>But the next verse somehow brought back
to him all the terror he had felt in his flight
over the sea, when the sound of the hissing
waters had reached his ears through the
carpet of fog:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"O misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persuasive moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth's tides are ever rising;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the awful grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy weird white face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leap the seas to thy enticing!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then followed the voice that had started the
horrid song. This time he was sure it was not
Miss Lake's voice, but only a very clever
imitation of it. Moreover, it again ended in a
shriek of laughter that froze his blood:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"O misty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deceiving moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy silvery glance brings sadness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who flies to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From land or sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall end&mdash;his&mdash;days&mdash;in&mdash;<em class="uc">MADNESS</em>!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other voices began to laugh and sing, but
Jimbo stopped his ears, for he simply could
not bear any more. He felt certain, too, that
these strange words to the moon had all been
part of a trap&mdash;a device to draw him to the
window. He shuddered to think how nearly
he had fallen into it, and determined to lie
on the bed and wait till he heard his companion
calling, and knew beyond all doubt
that it was she.</p>

<p>But the night passed away and the dawn
came, and no voice had called him forth to
the last flight.</p>

<p>Hitherto, in all his experiences, there had
been only one absolute certainty: the appearance
of the governess with the morning light.
But this time sunrise came and the clouds
cleared away, and the sweet smells of field
and air stole into the little room, yet without
any sign of the governess. The hours passed,
and she did not come, till finally he realised
that she was not coming at all, and he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
have to spend the whole day alone. Something
had happened to prevent her, or else it
was all part of her mysterious "plan." He
did not know, and all he could do was to wait,
and wonder, and hope.</p>

<p>All day long he lay and waited, and all day
long he was alone. The trap-door never once
moved; the courtyard remained empty and
deserted; there was no sound on the landing
or on the stairs; no wind stirred the leaves
outside, and the hot sun poured down out of
a cloudless sky. He stood by the open
window for hours watching the motionless
branches. Everything seemed dead; not
even a bird crossed his field of vision. The
loneliness, the awful silence, and above all, the
dread of the approaching night, were sometimes
more than he seemed able to bear; and
he wanted to put his head out of the window
and scream, or lie down on the bed and cry
his heart out. But he yielded to neither
impulse; he kept a brave heart, knowing
that this would be his last night in prison, and
that in a few hours' time he would hear his
name called out of the sky, and would dash
through the window to liberty and the last
wild flight. This thought gave him courage,
and he kept all his energy for the great effort.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p><p>Gradually, once more, the sunlight faded,
and the darkness began to creep over the land.
Never before had the shadows under the elms
looked so fantastic, nor the bushes in the field
beyond assumed such sinister shapes. The
Empty House was being gradually invested;
the enemy was masquerading already under
cover of these very shadows.</p>

<p>Very soon, he felt, the attack would begin,
and he must be ready to act.</p>

<p>The night came down at last with a strange
suddenness, and with it the warning of the
governess came back to him; he thought
quakingly of the stricken children who had
been caught and deprived of their wings; and
then he pulled out his long red feathers and
tried their strength, and gained thus fresh
confidence in their power to save him when
the time came.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="chapsub">OFF!</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the full darkness a whole army of horrors
crept nearer. He felt sure of this, though he
could actually see nothing. The house was
surrounded, the courtyard crowded. Outside,
on the stairs, in the other rooms, even on
the roof itself, waited dreadful things ready
to catch him, to tear off his wings, to make
him prisoner for ever and ever.</p>

<p>The possibility that something had happened
to the governess now became a probability.
Imperceptibly the change was wrought;
he could not say how or when exactly; but
he now felt almost certain that the effort
to keep her out of the way had succeeded. If
this were true, the boy's only hope lay in his
wings, and he pulled them out to their full
length and kissed them passionately, speaking
to the strong red feathers as if they were
living little persons.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p><p>"You must save me! You will save me,
won't you?" he cried in his anguish. And
every time he did this and looked at them he
gained fresh hope and courage.</p>

<p>The problem <em>where he was to fly to</em> had not
yet insisted on a solution, though it lay
always at the back of his mind; for the final
flight of escape without a guide had never
been even a possibility before.</p>

<p>Lying there alone in the darkness, waiting
for the sound of the voice so longed-for, he
found his thoughts turning again to the moon,
and the strange words of the song that had
puzzled him the night before. What in the
world did it all mean? Why all this about
the moon? Why was it a cruel moon, and
why should it attract and persuade and entice
him? He felt sure, the more he thought of
it, that this had all been a device to draw him
to the window&mdash;and perhaps even farther.</p>

<p>The darkness began to terrify him; he
dreaded more and more the waiting, listening
things that it concealed. Oh, when would the
governess call to him? When would he be
able to dash through the open window and
join her in the sky?</p>

<p>He thought of the sunlight that had flooded
the yard all day&mdash;so bright it seemed to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
come from a sun fresh made and shining for
the first time. He thought of the exquisite
flowers that grew in the fields just beyond the
high wall, and the night smells of the earth
reached him through the window, wafted in
upon a wind heavy with secrets of woods and
fields. They all came from a Land of Magic
that after to-night might be for ever beyond
his reach, and they went straight to his heart
and immediately turned something solid there
into tears. But the tears did not find their
natural expression, and Jimbo lay there fighting
with his pain, keeping all his strength for
the one great effort, and waiting for the voice
that at any minute now might sound above
the tree-tops.</p>

<p>But the hours passed and the voice did not
come.</p>

<p>How he loathed the room and everything
in it. The ceiling stretched like a white,
staring countenance above him; the walls
watched and listened; and even the mantelpiece
grew into the semblance of a creature
with drawn-up shoulders bending over him.
The whole room, indeed, seemed to his
frightened soul to run into the shape of a
monstrous person whose arms were outstretched
in all directions to prevent his escape.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p><p>His hands never left his wings now. He
stroked and fondled them, arranging the
feathers smoothly and speaking to them under
his breath just as though they were living
things. To him they were indeed alive, and
he knew when the time came they would not
fail him. The fierce passion for the open
spaces took possession of his soul, and his
whole being began to cry out for freedom,
rushing wind, the stars, and a pathless sky.</p>

<p>Slowly the power of the great, open Night
entered his heart, bringing with it a courage
that enabled him to keep the terrors of the
House at a distance.</p>

<p>So far, the boy's strength had been equal
to the task, but a moment was approaching
when the tension would be too great to bear,
and the long pent-up force would rush forth
into an act. Jimbo realised this quite clearly;
though he could not exactly express it in
words, he felt that his real hope of escape lay
in the success of that act. Meanwhile, with
more than a child's wisdom, he stored up every
particle of strength he had for the great
moment when it should come.</p>

<p>A light wind had risen soon after sunset,
but as the night wore on it began to fail,
dropping away into little silences that grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
each time longer. In the heart of one of
these spells of silence Jimbo presently noticed
a new sound&mdash;a sound that he recognised.</p>

<p>Far away at first, but growing in distinctness
with every dropping of the wind, this
new sound rose from the interior of the house
below and came gradually upon him. It was
voices faintly singing, and the tread of stealthy
footsteps.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the sound, till at
length they reached the door, and there passed
into the room a wave of fine, gentle sound
that woke no echo and scarcely seemed to
stir the air into vibration at all. The door
had opened, and a number of voices were
singing softly under their breath.</p>

<p>And after the sounds, creeping slowly like
some timid animal, there came into the room
a small black figure just visible in the faint
starlight. It peered round the edge of the
door, hesitated a moment, and then advanced
with an odd rhythmical sort of motion. And
after the first figure came a second, and after
the second a third; and then several entered
together, till a whole group of them stood on
the floor between Jimbo and the open window.</p>

<p>Then he recognised the Frightened Children
and his heart sank. Even they, he saw, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
arrayed against him, and took it for granted
that he already belonged to them.</p>

<p>Oh, why did not the governess come for
him? Why was there no voice in the sky?
He glanced with longing towards the heavens,
and as the children moved past, he was
almost certain that he saw the stars <em>through</em>
their bodies too.</p>

<p>Slowly they shuffled across the floor till
they formed a semicircle round the bed; and
then they began a silent, impish dance that
made the flesh creep. Their thin forms were
dressed in black gowns like shrouds, and as
they moved through the steps of the bizarre
measure he saw that their legs were little
more than mere skin and bone. Their faces&mdash;what
he could see of them when he dared
to open his eyes&mdash;were pale as ashes, and their
beady little eyes shone like the facets of cut
stones, flashing in all directions. And while
they danced in and out amongst each other,
never breaking the semicircle round the bed,
they sang a low, mournful song that sounded
like the wind whispering through a leafless
wood.</p>

<p>And the words stirred in him that vague
yet terrible fear known to all children who
have been frightened and made to feel afraid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the dark. Evidently his sensations were
being merged very rapidly now into those of
the little boy in the night-nursery bed.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>By this time the dreadful dancers had come
much closer to him, shifting stealthily nearer
to the bed under cover of their dancing, and
always <em>between him and the window</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly their intention flashed upon him;
they meant to prevent his escape!</p>

<p>With a tremendous effort he sprang from
the bed. As he did so a dozen pairs of thin,
shadowy arms shot out towards him as though
to seize his wings; but with an agility born
of fright he dodged them, and ran swiftly into
the corner by the mantelpiece. Standing with
his back against the wall he faced the children,
and strove to call out for help to the governess;
but this time there was an entirely new
difficulty in the way, for he found to his utter
dismay that his voice refused to make itself
heard. His mouth was dry and his tongue
would hardly stir.</p>

<p>Not a sound issued from his lips, but the
children instantly moved forwards and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
hemmed him in between them and the wall;
and to reach the window he would have to
break through this semicircle of whispering,
shadowy forms. Above their heads he could
see the stars shining, and any moment he
might hear Miss Lake's voice calling to him
to come out. His heart rose with passionate
longing within him, and he gathered his wings
tightly about him ready for the final dash. It
would take more than the Frightened Children
to hold him prisoner when once he heard that
voice, or even without it!</p>

<p>Whether they were astonished at his boldness,
or merely waiting their opportunity
later, he could not tell; but anyhow they
kept their distance for a time and made no
further attempt to seize his feathers. Whispering
together under their breath, sometimes
singing their mournful, sighing songs, sometimes
sinking their voices to a confused
murmur, they moved in and out amongst each
other with soundless feet like the shadows of
branches swaying in the wind.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, they moved closer and
stretched out their arms towards him, their
bodies swaying rhythmically together, while
their combined voices, raised just above a
whisper, sang to him&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>And, following these words, came from
somewhere in the air that voice like the thunder
of a river. Jimbo knew only too well to whom
it belonged as he listened to the rhyme of the
West Wind&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">"For the Wind of the West<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a wind unblest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its dangerous breath<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fly not with the Wind of the West, O child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the terrible Wind of the West!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the boy knew perfectly well that these
efforts to stop him were all part of a trap.
They were lying to him. It was not the
Wind of the West at all; <em>it was the South
Wind</em>! That at least he knew by the odours
that were wafted in through the window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Again he tried to call to the governess, but
his tongue lay stiff in his mouth and no
sound came.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the children began to draw
closer, hemming him in. They moved almost
imperceptibly, but he saw plainly that the
circle was growing smaller and smaller. His
legs began to tremble, and he felt that soon
he would collapse and drop at their feet, for
his strength was failing and the power to act
and move was slowly leaving him.</p>

<p>The little shadowy figures were almost
touching him, when suddenly a new sound
broke the stillness and set every nerve tingling
in his body.</p>

<p>Something was shuffling along the landing.
He heard it outside, pushing against the door.
The handle turned with a rattle, and a moment
later the door slowly opened.</p>

<p>For a second Jimbo's breath failed him,
and he nearly fell in a heap upon the floor.
Round the edge of the door he saw a dim
huge figure come crawling into the room&mdash;creeping
along the floor&mdash;and trailing behind
it a pair of immense black wings that stretched
along the boards. For one brief second he
stared, horror-stricken, and wondering what
it was. But before the whole length of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
creature was in, he knew. It was Fright
himself! <em>And he was making steadily for the
window!</em></p>

<p>The shock instantly galvanised the boy into
a state of activity again. He recovered the
use of all his muscles and all his faculties.
His voice, released by terror, rang out in a
wild shriek for help to the governess, and he
dashed forward across the room in a mad rush
for the window. Unless he could reach it
before the other, he would be a prisoner for
the rest of his life. It was now or never.</p>

<p>The instant he moved, the children came
straight at him with hands outstretched to
stop him; but he passed through them as if
they were smoke, and with almost a single
bound sprang upon the narrow window-sill.
To do this he had to clear the head and
shoulders of the creature on the floor, and
though he accomplished it successfully, he
felt himself clutched from behind. For a
second he balanced doubtfully on the window
ledge. He felt himself being pulled back into
the room, and he combined all his forces into
one tremendous effort to rush forward.</p>

<p>There was a ripping, tearing sound as he
sprang into the air with a yell of mingled
terror and exultation. His prompt action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and the fierce impetus had saved him. He
was free. But in the awful hand that seized
him he had left behind the end feathers of
his right wing. A few inches more and it
would have been not merely the feathers, but
the entire wing itself.</p>

<p>He dropped to within three feet of the stones
in the yard, and then, borne aloft by the kind,
rushing Wind of the South, he rose in a tremendous
sweep far over the tops of the high
elms and out into the heart of the night.</p>

<p>Only there was no governess's voice to
guide him; and behind him, a little lower
down, a black pursuing figure with huge wings
flapped heavily as it followed with laborious
flight through the darkness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="chapsub">HOME</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> it was the sound of something crashing
heavily through the top branches of the elms
that made the boy realise he was actually
being followed; and all his efforts became
concentrated into the desire to put as much
distance as possible between himself and the
horror of the Empty House.</p>

<p>He heard the noise of big wings far beneath
him, and his one idea was to out-distance
his pursuer and then come down again to
earth and rest his wings in the branches of
a tree till he could devise some plan how to
find the governess. So at first he raced at
full speed through the air, taking no thought
of direction.</p>

<p>When he looked down, all he could see was
that something vague and shadowy, shaking
out a pair of enormous wings between him
and the earth, move along with him. Its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
path was parallel with his own, but apparently
it made no effort to rise up to his higher level.
It thundered along far beneath him, and instinctively
he raised his head and steered more
and more upwards and away from the world.</p>

<p>The gap at the end of his right wing where
the feathers had been torn out seemed to
make no difference in his power of flight or
steering, and he went tearing through the
night at a pace he had never dared to try
before, and at a height he had never yet
reached in any of the practice flights. He
soared higher even than he knew; and perhaps
this was fortunate, for the friction of the
lower atmosphere might have heated him to
the point of igniting, and some watcher at
one of earth's windows might have suddenly
seen a brilliant little meteor flash through the
night and vanish into dust.</p>

<p>At first the joy of escape was the only idea
his mind seemed able to grasp; he revelled
in a passionate sense of freedom, and all his
energies poured themselves into one concentrated
effort to fly faster, faster, faster. But
after a time, when the pursuer had been
apparently outflown, and he realised that
escape was an accomplished fact, he began to
search for the governess, calling to her, rising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and falling, darting in all directions, and then
hovering on outstretched wings to try and
catch some sound of a friendly voice.</p>

<p>But no answer came, either from the stars
that crowded the vault above, or from the
dark surface of the world below; only silence
answered his cries, and his voice was swallowed
up and lost in the immensity of space almost
the moment it left his lips.</p>

<p>Presently he began to realise to what an
appalling distance he had risen above the
world, and with anxious eyes he tried to pierce
the gaping emptiness beneath him and on all
sides. But this vast sea of air had nothing
to reveal. The stars shone like pinholes of
gold pricked in a deep black curtain; and
the moon, now rising slowly, spread a veil of
silver between him and the upper regions.
There was not a cloud anywhere and the
winds were all asleep. He was alone in space.
Yet, as the swishing of his feathers slackened
and the roar in his ears died away, he heard
in the short pause the ominous beating of
great wings somewhere in the depths beneath
him, and knew that the great pursuer was still
on his track.</p>

<p>The glare of the moon now made it impossible
to distinguish anything properly, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
these huge spaces, with nothing to guide the
eye, it was difficult to know exactly from
what direction the sound came. He was only
sure of one thing&mdash;that it was far below him,
and that for the present it did not seem to
come much nearer. The cry for help that
kept rising to his lips he suppressed, for it
would only have served to guide his pursuer;
and, moreover, a cry&mdash;a little thin, despairing
cry&mdash;was instantly lost in these great
heavens. It was less than a drop in an ocean.</p>

<p>On and on he flew, always pointing away
from the earth, and trying hard to think
where he would find safety. Would this awful
creature hunt him all night long into the
daylight, or would he be forced back into the
Empty House in sheer exhaustion? The
thought gave him new impetus, and with
powerful strokes he dashed onwards and
upwards through the wilderness of space in
which the only pathways were the little
golden tracks of the starbeams. The governess
would turn up somewhere; he was positive
of that. She had never failed him yet.</p>

<p>So, alone and breathless, he pursued his
flight, and the higher he went the more the
tremendous vault opened up into inconceivable
and untold distances. His speed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
kept increasing; he thought he had never
found flying so easy before; and the thunder
of the following wings that held persistently
on his track made it dangerous for him to
slacken up for more than a minute here and
there. The earth became a dark blot beneath
him, while the moon, rising higher and higher,
grew weirdly bright and close. How black
the sky was; how piercing the points of starlight;
how stimulating the strong, new
odours of these lofty regions! He realised
with a thrill of genuine awe that he had flown
over the very edge of the world, and the
moment the thought entered his mind it was
flung back at him by a voice that seemed close
to his ear one moment, and the next was miles
away in the space overhead. Light thoughts,
born of the stars and the moon and of his
great speed, danced before his mind in fanciful
array. Once he laughed aloud at them, but
once only. The sound of his voice in these
echoless spaces made him afraid.</p>

<p>The speed, too, affected his vision, for at
one moment thin clouds stretched across his
face, and the next he was whirling through
perfectly clear air again with no vestige of a
cloud in sight. The same reason doubtless
explained the sudden presence of sheets of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
light in the air that reflected the moonlight
like particles of glittering ice, and then suddenly
disappeared again. The terrific speed
would explain a good many things, but
certainly it was curious how creatures formed
out of the hollow darkness, like foam before
a steamer's bows, and moved noiselessly away
on either side to join the army of dim life that
crowded everywhere and watched his passage.
For, in front and on both sides, there gathered
a vast assembly of silent forms more than
shadows, less than bodily shapes, that opened
up a pathway as he rushed through them,
and then immediately closed up their ranks
again when he had passed. The air seemed
packed with living creatures. Space was
filled with them. They surrounded him on all
sides. Yet his passage through them was like
the passage of a hand through smoke; it was
easy to make a pathway, but the pathway
left no traces behind it. More smoke rushed
in and filled the void.</p>

<p>He could never see these things properly,
face to face; they always kept just out of
the line of vision, like shadows that follow a
lonely walker in a wood and vanish the
moment he turns to look at them over his
shoulder. But ever by his side, with a steady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
effortless motion, he knew they kept up with
him&mdash;strange inhabitants of the airless heights,
immense and misty-winged, with veiled,
flaming eyes and silent feathers. He was not
afraid of them; for they were neither friendly
nor hostile; they were simply the beings of
another world, alien and unknown.</p>

<p>But what puzzled him more was that the
light and the darkness seemed separate things,
each distinctly visible. After each stroke of
his wings he <em>saw the darkness</em> sift downwards
past him through the air like dust. It floated
all round him in thinnest diaphanous texture&mdash;visible,
not because the moonlight made it so,
but because in its inmost soul it was itself
luminous. It rose and fell in eddies, swirling
wreaths, and undulations; inwoven with starbeams,
as with golden thread, it clothed him
about in circles of some magical primordial
substance.</p>

<p>Even the stars, looking down upon him
from terrifying heights, seemed now draped,
now undraped, as if by the sweeping of
enormous wings that stirred these sheets of
visible darkness into a vast system of circulation
through the heavens. Everything in
these oceans of upper space apparently made
use of wings, or the idea of wings. Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
even the great earth itself, rolling from star
to star, was moved by the power of gigantic,
invisible wings!...</p>

<p>Jimbo realised he had entered a forbidden
region. He began to feel afraid.</p>

<p>But the only possible expression of his fear,
and its only possible relief, lay in his own
wings&mdash;and he used them with redoubled
energy. He dashed forward so fast that his
face begun to burn, and he kept turning his
head in every direction for a sign of the
governess, or for some indication of where he
could <em>escape to</em>. In the pauses of the wild
flight he heard the thunder of the following
wings below. They were still on his trail,
and it seemed that they were gaining on him.</p>

<p>He took a new angle, realising that his only
chance was to fly high; and the new course
took him perpendicularly away from the earth
and straight towards the moon. Later, when
he had out-distanced the other creature, he
would drop down again to safer levels.</p>

<p>Yet the hours passed and it never overtook
him. A measured distance was steadily kept
up between them as though with calculated
purpose.</p>

<p>Curious distant voices shouted from time to
time all manner of sentences and rhymes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
his ears, but he could neither understand nor
remember them. More and more the awful
stillness of the vast regions that lie between
the world and the moon appalled him.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a new sound reached him
that at first he could not in the least understand.
It reached him, however, not through
the ears, but by a steady trembling of the whole
surface of his body. It set him in vibration
all over, and for some time he had no idea
what it meant. The trembling ran deeper and
deeper into his body, till at last a single,
powerful, regular vibration took complete
possession of his whole being, and he felt as
though he was being wrapped round and
absorbed by this vast and gigantic sound.
He had always thought that the voice of
Fright, like the roar of a river, was the loudest
and deepest sound he had ever heard. Even
that set his soul a-trembling. But this new,
tremendous, rolling-ocean of a voice came not
that way, and could not be compared to it.
The voice of the other was a mere tickling of
the ear compared to this awful crashing of
seas and mountains and falling worlds. It
must break him to pieces, he felt.</p>

<p>Suddenly he knew what it was,&mdash;and for a
second his wings failed him:&mdash;he had reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
such a height that he could hear the roar of
the world as it thundered along its journey
through space! That was the meaning of
this voice of majesty that set him all a-trembling.
And before long he would probably
hear, too, the voices of the planets, and the
singing of the great moon. The governess
had warned him about this. At the first
sound of these awful voices she told him to
turn instantly and drop back to the earth as
fast as ever he could drop.</p>

<p>Jimbo turned instinctively and began to
fall. But, before he had dropped half a mile,
he met once again the ascending sound of the
wings that had followed him from the Empty
House.</p>

<p>It was no good flying straight into destruction.
He summoned all his courage and
turned once more towards the stars. Anything
was better than being caught and held for ever
by Fright, and with a wild cry for help that
fell dead in the empty spaces, he renewed his
unending flight towards the stars.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, the pursuer had distinctly
gained. Appalled by the mighty thunder of
the stars' voices above, and by the prospect
of immediate capture if he turned back, Jimbo
flew blindly on towards the moon, regardless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of consequences. And below him the Pursuer
came closer and closer. The strokes of its
wings were no longer mere distant thuds that
he heard when he paused in his own flight to
listen; they were the audible swishing of
feathers. It was near enough for that.</p>

<p>Jimbo could never properly see what was
following him. A shadow between him and
the earth was all he could distinguish, but in
the centre of that shadow there seemed to
burn two glowing eyes. Two brilliant lights
flashed whenever he looked down, like the
lamps of a revolving lighthouse. But other
things he saw, too, when he looked down,
and once the earth rose close to his face so
that he could have touched it with his hands.
The same instant it dropped away again with
a rush of whirlwinds, and became a distant
shadow miles and miles below him. But
before it went, he had time to see the Empty
House standing within its gloomy yard, and
the horror of it gave him fresh impetus.</p>

<p>Another time when the world raced up close
to his eyes he saw a scene of a different kind
that stirred a passionately deep yearning
within him&mdash;a house overgrown with ivy and
standing among trees and gardens, with
laburnums and lilacs flowering on smooth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
green lawns, and a clean gravel drive leading
down to a big pair of iron gates. Oh, it all
seemed so familiar! Perhaps in another
minute the well-known figures would have
appeared and spoken to him. Already he
heard their voices behind the bushes. But,
just before they appeared, the earth dropped
back with a roar of a thousand winds, and
Jimbo saw instead the shadow of the Pursuer
mounting, mounting, mounting towards him.
Up he shot again with terror in his heart, and
all trembling with the thunder of the great
star-voices above. He felt like a leaf in a
hurricane, "lost, dizzy, shelterless."</p>

<p>Voices, too, now began to be heard more
frequently. They dropped upon him out of
the reaches of this endless void; and with
them sometimes came forms that shot past
him with amazing swiftness, racing into the
empty Beyond as though sucked into a vast
vacuum. The very stars seemed to move.
He became part of some much larger movement
in which he was engulfed and merged.
He could no longer think of himself as Jimbo.
When he uttered his own name he saw merely
a mass of wind and colour through which the
great pulses of space and the planets beat
tumultuously, lapping him round with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
currents of a terrific motion that seemed to
swallow up his own little personality entirely,
while giving him something infinitely
greater....</p>

<p>But surely these small voices, shrill and
trumpet-like, did not come from the stars!
these deep whispers that ran round the
immense vault overhead and sounded almost
familiarly in his ears&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give it him the moment he wakes."</p>

<p>"Bring the ice-bag ... quick!"</p>

<p>"Put the hot bottle to his feet <em class="ucsmcap">IMMEDIATELY</em>!"</p>

<p>The voices shrieked all round him, turning
suddenly into soft whispers that died away
somewhere among his feathers. The soles of
his feet began to glow, and he felt a gigantic
hand laid upon his throat and head. Almost
it seemed as if he were lying somewhere on
his back, and people were bending over him,
shouting and whispering.</p>

<p>"Why hangs the moon so red?" cried a
voice that was instantly drowned in a chorus
of unintelligible whispering.</p>

<p>"The black cow must be killed," whispered
some one deep within the sky.</p>

<p>"Why drips the rain so cold?" yelled one
of the hideous children close behind him. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
a third called with a distant laughter from
behind a star&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why sings the wind so shrill?"</p>

<p>"<em class="smcap">Quiet!</em>" roared an appalling voice below,
as if all the rivers of the world had suddenly
turned loose into the sky. "<em class="smcap">Quiet!</em>"</p>

<p>Instantly a star, that had been hovering for
some time on the edge of a fantastic dance,
dropped down close in front of his face. It
had a glaring disc, with mouth and eyes. An
icy hand seemed laid on his head, and the
star rushed back into its place in the sky,
leaving a trail of red flame behind it. A
little voice seemed to go with it, growing
fainter and fainter in the distance&mdash;</p>

<p>"We dance with phantoms and with
shadows play."</p>

<p>But, regardless of everything, Jimbo flew
onwards and upwards, terrified and helpless
though he was. His thoughts turned without
ceasing to the governess, and he felt sure that
she would yet turn up in time to save him
from being caught by the Fright that pursued,
or lost among the fearful spaces that lay
beyond the stars.</p>

<p>For a long time, however, his wings had been
growing more and more tired, and the prospect
of being destroyed from sheer exhaustion now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
presented itself to the boy vaguely as a possible
alternative&mdash;vaguely only, because he
was no longer able to think, properly speaking,
and things came to him more by way of dull
feeling than anything else.</p>

<p>It was all the more with something of a
positive shock, therefore, that he realised the
change. For a change had come. He was
now sudden by conscious of an influx of new
power&mdash;greater than anything he had ever
known before in any of his flights. His wings
now suddenly worked as if by magic. Never
had the motion been so easy, and it became
every minute easier and easier. He simply
flashed along without apparent effort. An
immense driving power had entered into him.
He realised that he could fly for ever without
getting tired. His pace increased tenfold&mdash;increased
alarmingly. The possibility of exhaustion
vanished utterly. Jimbo knew now
that something was wrong. This new driving
power was something wholly outside himself.
His wings were working far too easily. Then,
suddenly, he understood: <em>His wings were not
working at all!</em></p>

<p>He was not being driven forward from
behind; he was being drawn forward from
in front.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p><p>He saw it all in a flash: Miss Lake's warning
long ago about the danger of flying too high;
the last song of the Frightened Children,
"Dare you fly out alone through the shadows
that wave, when the course is unknown and
there's no one to save?" the strange words
sung to him about the "relentless misty
moon," and the object of the dreadful Pursuer
in steadily forcing him upwards and away
from the earth. It all flashed across his poor
little dazed mind. He understood at last.</p>

<p>He had soared too high and had entered the
sphere of the moon's attraction.</p>

<p>"The moon is too strong, and there's death
in the stars!" a voice bellowed below him
like the roar of a falling mountain, shaking
the sky.</p>

<p>The child flew screaming on. There was
nothing else he could do. But hardly had
the roar died away when another voice was
heard, a tender voice, a whispering, sympathetic
voice, though from what part of the
sky it came he could not tell&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arrange the pillows for his little head."</p>

<p>But below him the wings of the Pursuer
were mounting closer and closer. He could
almost feel the mighty wind from their
feathers, and hear the rush of the great body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
between them. It was impossible to slacken
his speed even had he wished; no strength
on earth could have resisted that terrible
power drawing upwards towards the moon.
Instinctively, however, he realised that he
would rather have gone forwards than backwards.
He never could have faced capture
by that dreadful creature behind. All the
efforts of the past weeks to escape from
Fright, the owner of the Empty House, now
acted upon him with a cumulative effect, and
added to the suction of the moon-life. He
shot forward at a pace that increased with
every second.</p>

<p>At the back of his mind, too, lay some kind
of faint perception that the governess would,
after all, be there to help him. She had
always turned up before when he was in
danger, and she would not fail him now.
But this was a mere ghost of a thought that
brought little comfort, and merely added its
quota of force to the speed that whipped
him on, ever faster, into the huge white
moon-world in front.</p>

<p>For this, then, he had escaped from the
horror of the Empty House! To be sucked
up into the moon, the "relentless, misty
moon"&mdash;to be drawn into its cruel, silver web,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and destroyed. The Song to the Misty Moon
outside the window came back in snatches
and added to his terror; only it seemed now
weeks ago since he had heard it. Something
of its real meaning, too, filtered down into his
heart, and he trembled anew to think that
the moon could be a great, vast, moving
Being, alive and with a purpose....</p>

<p>But why, oh, why did they keep shouting
these horrid snatches of the song through
the sky? Trapped! Trapped! The word
haunted him through the night:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy songs are nightly driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sky to sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the old, grey hills of heaven!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Caught!</em> Caught at last! The moon's
prisoner, a captive in her airless caves; alone
on her dead white plains; searching for ever
in vain for the governess; wandering alone
and terrified.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By the awful grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy weird white face.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The thought crazed him, and he struggled
like a bird caught in a net. But he might as
well have struggled to push the worlds out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of their courses. The power against him was
the power of the universe in which he was
nothing but a little, lost, whirling atom. It
was all of no avail, and the moon did not even
smile at his feeble efforts. He was too light
to revolve round her, too impalpable to create
his own orbit; he had not even the consistency
of a comet; he had reached the
point of stagnation, as it were&mdash;the dead
level&mdash;the neutral zone where the attractions
of the earth and moon meet and counterbalance
one another&mdash;where bodies have no
weight and existence no meaning.</p>

<p>Now the moon was close upon him; he
could see nothing else. There lay the vast,
shining sea of light in front of him. Behind,
the roar of the following creature grew fainter
and fainter, as he outdistanced it in the awful
swiftness of the huge drop down upon the
moon mountains.</p>

<p>Already he was close enough to its surface
to hear nothing of its great singing but a deep,
confused murmur. And, as the distance
increased, he realised that the change in his
own condition increased. He felt as if he
were flying off into a million tiny particles&mdash;breaking
up under the effects of the deadly
speed and the action of the new moon-forces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Immense, invisible arms, half-silver and half-shadow,
grew out of the white disc and drew
him downwards upon her surface. He was
being merged into the life of the moon.</p>

<p>There was a pause. For a moment his
wings stopped dead. Their vain fluttering
was all but over....</p>

<p>Hark! Was that a voice borne on the
wings of some lost wind? Why should his
heart beat so tumultuously all at once?</p>

<p>He turned and stared into the ocean of
black air overhead till it turned him dizzy.
A violent trembling ran through his tired
being from head to foot. He had heard a
voice&mdash;a voice that he knew and loved&mdash;a
voice of help and deliverance. It rang in
shrill syllables up the empty spaces, and it
reached new centres of force within him that
touched his last store of courage and strength.</p>

<p>"Jimbo, hold on!" it cried, like a faint,
thin, pricking current of sound almost unable
to reach him through the seas of distance.
"I'm coming; hold on a little longer!"</p>

<p>It was the governess. She was true to the
end. Jimbo felt his heart swell within him.
She was mounting, mounting behind him with
incredible swiftness. The sound of his own
name in these terrible regions recalled to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
some degree of concentration, and he strove
hard to fight against the drawing power that
was seeking his destruction.</p>

<p>He struggled frantically with his wings.
But between him and the governess there was
still the power of Fright to be overcome&mdash;the
very Power she had long ago invoked. It
was following him still, preventing his turning
back, and driving him ever forward to his death.</p>

<p>Again the voice sounded in the night; and
this time it was closer. He could not quite
distinguish the words. They buzzed oddly
in his ears ... other voices mingled with
them ... the hideous children began to
shriek somewhere underneath him ... wings
with eyes among their burning feathers flashed
past him.</p>

<p>His own wings folded close over his little
body, drooping like dead things. His eyes
closed, and he turned on his side. A huge
face that was one-half the governess and the
other half the head gardener at home, thrust
itself close against his own, and blew upon his
eyelids till he opened them. Already he was
falling, sinking, tumbling headlong through a
space that offered no resistance.</p>

<p>"Jimbo!" shrieked a voice that instantly
died away into a wail behind him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p><p>He opened his eyes once more&mdash;for it was
that loved voice again&mdash;but the glare from
the moon so dazzled him that he could only
fancy he saw the figure of the governess, not
a hundred feet away, struggling and floundering
in the clutch of a black creature that beat the
air with enormous wings all round her. He
saw her hair streaming out into the night,
and one wing seemed to hang broken and
useless at her side.</p>

<p>He was turning over and over, like a piece
of wood in the waves of the sea, and the
governess, caught by Fright, the monster of
her own creation, drifted away from his
consciousness as a dream melts away in the
light of the morning.... From the gleaming
mountains and treeless plains below Jimbo
thought there rose a hollow roar like the
mocking laughter of an immense multitude of
people, shaking with mirth. The Moon had
got him at last, and her laughter ran through
the heavens like a wave. Revolving upon his
own little axis so swiftly that he neither saw
nor heard anything more, he dropped straight
down upon the great satellite.</p>

<p>The light of the moon flamed up into his
eyes and dazzled him.</p>

<p>But what in the world was this?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p><p>How could the moon dwindle so suddenly
to the size of a mere lamp flame?</p>

<p>How could the whole expanse of the
heavens shrink in an instant to the limits of
a little, cramped room?</p>

<p>In a single second, before he had time to
realise that he felt surprise, the entire memory
of his recent experiences vanished from his
mind. The past became an utter blank.
Like a wreath of smoke everything melted
away as if it had never been at all. The
functions of the brain resumed their normal
course. The delirium of the past few hours
was over.</p>

<p>Jimbo was lying at home on his bed in the
night-nursery, and his mother was bending
over him. At the foot of the bed stood the
doctor in black. The nurse held a lamp, only
half shaded by her hand, as she approached
the bedside.</p>

<p>This lamp was the moon of his delirium&mdash;only
he had quite forgotten now that there
had ever been any moon at all.</p>

<p>The little thermometer, thrust into his
teeth among the stars, was still in his mouth.
A hot-water bottle made his feet glow and
burn. And from the walls of the sick-room
came as it were the echoes of recently-uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
sentences: "Take his temperature! Give
him the medicine the moment he wakes!
Put the hot bottle to his feet.... Fetch the
ice-bag.... Quick!"</p>

<p>"Where am I, mother?" he asked in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"You're in bed, darling, and must keep
quite quiet. You'll soon be all right again.
It was the old black cow that tossed you.
The gardener found you by the swinging gate
and carried you in.... You've been unconscious!"</p>

<p>"How long have I been uncon&mdash;&mdash;?"
Jimbo could not manage the whole
word.</p>

<p>"About three hours, darling."</p>

<p>Then he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep,
and when he woke long after it was early
morning, and there was no one in the room
but the old family nurse, who sat watching
beside the bed. Something&mdash;some dim
memory&mdash;that had stirred his brain in sleep,
immediately rushed to his lips in the form of
an inconsequent question. But before he
could even frame the sentence, the thought
that prompted it had slipped back into the
deeper consciousness he had just left behind
with the trance of deep sleep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p><p>But the old nurse, watching every movement,
waiting upon the child's very breath,
had caught the question, and she answered
soothingly in a whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Lake died a few days after she
left here," she said in a very low voice. "But
don't think about her any more, dearie!
She'll never frighten children again with her
silly stories."</p>

<p>"<em>DIED!</em>"</p>

<p>Jimbo sat up in bed and stared into the
shadows behind her, as though his eyes saw
something she could not see. But his voice
seemed almost to belong to some one else.</p>

<p>"She was really dead all the time, then,"
he said below his breath.</p>

<p>Then the child fell back without another
word, and dropped off into the sleep which
was the first step to final recovery.</p>
